= Deploying a CloudHub Application

To deploy a CloudHub application, you simply upload it to CloudHub and
the platform automatically deploys your application.

You can deploy an application to CloudHub directly from Anypoint™
Studio, or you can deploy it using the CloudHub console.

This page covers deployment via the console. For an example of deploying
to CloudHub directly from Anypoint Studio, see
the link:/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub#HelloWorldonCloudHub-DeployingandRunningYourProject[Hello
World on CloudHub Tutorial].

[[DeployingaCloudHubApplication-CreatinganApplicationDomain]]
== Creating an Application Domain

Every application requires a unique application domain name. The
application domain identifies your application in CloudHub and also
provides you with a public URL,
`http://myapplicationdomain.cloudhub.io`, for accessing the application
if it exposes any inbound endpoints.

To create a new application, click on the **Add application **button on
the CloudHub console. On the **Add application** dialog, enter a unique
application domain name. Valid domain names must start with a letter,
may contain alphanumeric characters and dashes, and contain fewer than
42 characters. If the name is valid, CloudHub alerts you whether it is
available or already reserved by another user.

[[DeployingaCloudHubApplication-ConfiguringApplicationSettings]]
== Configuring Application Settings

After your application domain has been created, you need to upload a new
file for deployment. Click the **Choose file **button, select your
application file, and then click **Open**. You can also click the **Get
from sandbox** button to copy over a file from a non-production
environment into your current environment. (If the Get From Sandbox
button does not appear, you may first need to create a non-production
environment in order to have this option.)

Next, you can select the **Mule Version** that you would like to deploy
to, using the drop-down menu.

[[DeployingaCloudHubApplication-WorkerSizing]]
== Worker Sizing

Allocate one or more *workers* to your application. For each
application, one or more workers are responsible for executing your
application logic. 

[cols="2"]
|=======================================================================
|image:/documentation/images/icons/emoticons/information.png[image] |All
applications are limited by default to no more than four workers.
Accounts that do not have
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Fabric[CloudHub Fabric]
enabled are limited to a single worker per application. If you need more
workers, please mailto:cloudhub-support@mulesoft.com[contact us]
directly.
|=======================================================================

A worker is the unit of compute work on CloudHub. There are 3 different
worker types: shared, regular, and double. These options allow you to
scale vertically to increase performance or throughput.

Shared workers offer limited CPU and IO for smaller work loads, with
burst capacity of up to 1 CPU. Currently, CloudHub does not allow
specifying which applications share a single worker. If shared workers
are not enabled on your account and you would like to have this option,
contact your account representative. 

Worker Type
Processing Power
Shared
1 shared vCPU +
750 MB memory 
Regular
1 vCPU +
1.5 GB memory 
Double
2 vCPU +
3 GB memory 
To allocate workers, select options from the drop-down menus to
configure the computing power that you need:

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981904/image2014-10-25+10%3A38%3A40.png?version=1&modificationDate=1414258721020[image]

If you have CloudHub Fabric enabled on your account, you can scale your
application horizontally by deploying up to four workers of any type.
Otherwise you are limited to 1 worker.

The examples below are based on an account subscription that owns five
workers. Two of these workers are already being used by other
applications, leaving three workers (or the equivalent computing power)
available.

Worker Sizing Selection
Results
1 Regular worker
Deploying to one regular worker is the default selection. Selecting this
option gives you one vCPU with 1.5 GB of memory for your application.
2 Regular workers
Deploying to two regular workers uses two workers, thus two separate
vCPUs with 1.5 GB of memory each. Selecting this option results in
automatic load-balancing. See
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Fabric#CloudHubFabric-WorkerScaleout[CloudHub
Fabric] for more information.
1 Double worker
Deploying to a double worker uses the same number of workers as
deploying to two regular workers, as in the line above. However, your
application is deployed to a single instance with more computing power
than two individual Mule instances.
1 Shared worker
Deploying to a shared worker gives you up to 750 MB of memory for your
application but uses only 25% of one worker out of those available on
your subscription.
2 Double worker
If you select more workers than are available in your account, CloudHub
allows you to create the application using the console, but you cannot
start your application until workers are available.
When deploying to more than one worker of any type, CloudHub
automatically load-balances any incoming traffic across your allocated
workers. For more information,
see link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Fabric[CloudHub
Fabric].

All free and professional account holders see the following option only:

1 Regular worker
All free and professional accounts are limited to a single worker per
application.

[[DeployingaCloudHubApplication-Region]]
=== Region

If you have global deployment enabled on your account, you can change
the *Region* to which your application deploys using the drop-down menu.
Administrators can
link:/documentation/display/current/Managing+CloudHub+Specific+Settings[set
the default region] on the Organization tab in Account Settings, but
that region can be adjusted here when the application is deployed, if
necessary.

* Note that applications deployed to Europe automatically have their
domain updated to `http://myapplicationdomain.eu.cloudhub.io`. 
* Note that applications deployed to Australia automatically have their
domain updated to `http://myapplicationdomain.au.cloudhub.io.`

[[DeployingaCloudHubApplication-SecureDataGatewayEnabled]]
=== Secure Data Gateway Enabled

Check this box if your application has a
link:/documentation/display/current/Secure+Data+Gateway[secure data
gateway] attached to it.

[[DeployingaCloudHubApplication-PersistentQueues]]
=== Persistent Queues

Check this box to enable persistent queues on your application.
Persistent queues protect against message loss and allow you to
distribute workloads across a set of workers. Before you can take
advantage of persistent queueing, your application needs to be set up to
use queues. See
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Fabric[CloudHub Fabric] for
more information.

[[DeployingaCloudHubApplication-AutomaticRestart]]
=== Automatic Restart

If you are deploying to a runtime that supports worker monitoring (3.4.0
runtime or later), you have the option to check **Automatically restart
application when not responding**. With this box checked, CloudHub
automatically restarts your application when the monitoring system
discovers a problem with your application. If this box is not checked,
CloudHub produces all the log messages, notifications, and any
configured alerts, but takes no action to restart the application. 

Read more about
link:/documentation/display/current/Worker+Monitoring[worker
monitoring].

[[DeployingaCloudHubApplication-ApplicationProperties]]
=== Application Properties

You can also optionally specify certain properties that may be required
by your application. This allows you to externalize important pieces of
configuration which may switch depending on the environment in which
you're deploying. For example, if you're using a Mule application
locally, you might configure your database host to be localhost. But if
you're using CloudHub, you might configure it to be an Amazon RDS
server.

To create an application property, expand the **Properties** section and
set the variable by either using a text `key=value` format or by using
the list format with two text boxes. After you've made the change, click
the **Apply changes** button. 

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981904/image2014-10-25+10%3A42%3A42.png?version=1&modificationDate=1414258963142[image]

These application properties can be used inside your Mule configuration.
For example:

If you also have the same properties set in a mule-app.properties file
inside your application, the application property settings in CloudHub
override mule-app.properties when your application is deployed.

Note that you can flag application properties as secure so that their
values are not visible to users at runtime or passed between the server
and the console. See
link:/documentation/display/current/Secure+Application+Properties[Secure
Application Properties] for more information.

[[DeployingaCloudHubApplication-CloudHubDeployment]]
== CloudHub Deployment

After you complete the above steps, click **Create** and CloudHub
uploads your application and automatically begins the deployment
process. During this process, your view is switched to the
link:/documentation/display/current/Viewing+Log+Data[log view] allowing
you to monitor the process of your application deployment. This process
could take several minutes. During the deployment, the application
status indicator changes to yellow to indicate deployment in progress.

When deployment is complete, the application status indicator changes to
green and you are notified in the status area that the application has
deployed successfully. Here's what is in the logs:

[[DeployingaCloudHubApplication-DeploymentErrors]]
== Deployment Errors

If an error occurs and the application cannot be deployed, the
application status indicator changes to red. You are alerted in the
status area that an error occurred. Please check the
link:/documentation/display/current/Viewing+Log+Data[log details] for
any application deployment errors. You need to correct the error, upload
the application, and deploy again.
