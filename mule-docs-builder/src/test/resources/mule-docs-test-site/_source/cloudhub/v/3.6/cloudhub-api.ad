[[CloudHubAPI-CloudHubAPI]]
= CloudHub API

The CloudHub REST API provides a way for you to programmatically access
much of CloudHub's functionality. It allows you to:

* Create applications
* Change application properties, including the number of workers and
environment variables
* Deploy a new version of your application
* Delete your application
* Get statistics about your application

Before getting started with specific operations, be sure you're familiar
with link:/documentation/display/current/Applications#Applications-OperationsforApplications[Operations
for Applications].

[[CloudHubAPI-DataFormat]]
== Data Format

All resources or methods that return or accept a type use the JSON as
the data format. As an example, here's data you might receive, in JSON
format, in response to a request to get an application:

[[CloudHubAPI-GettingStartedandAuthenticatingwiththeAPI]]
== Getting Started and Authenticating with the API

To use the API, you can use any HTTP client. All APIs use JSON as the
data format. If you use Java, we recommend you use the
http://wikis.sun.com/display/Jersey/Main[Jersey client] or
http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/index.html[HttpClient] with
http://jackson.codehaus.org[Jackson] for JSON support.

All APIs require HTTP basic authentication. Your username will control
which environment you're accessing and is of the form
"user@enviornment". For example, if your username is joe and you have an
environment called "Development", your username will be
joe@Development.  If you don't specify an environment, it will default
to production.

[[CloudHubAPI-StatusCodesandErrorHandling]]
== Status Codes and Error Handling

When you call the REST APIs, the following status codes are returned:

[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Status Code | Description

| 200 | The operation was successful.
| 201 | The resource (such as, application) was created. The Location header
will contain the location of the resource.
| 404 | The resource was not found.
| 409 | When creating a resource (such as, server, server group, or deployment),
a resource with that name already exists.
| 500 | The operation was unsuccessful. See the HTTP body for details.
|===

When errors occur (for example, a 500 status code), the HTTP response
contains a JSON response with an error message. For example:
