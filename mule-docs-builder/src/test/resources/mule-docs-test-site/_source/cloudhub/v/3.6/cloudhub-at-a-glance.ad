= CloudHub at a Glance

*Hello George!*

Before getting started with CloudHub, it's important to understand some
basic concepts. After this short overview, you'll be ready to build your
first CloudHub integration with the
link:/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub[Hello World
on CloudHub] tutorial!

[[CloudHubataGlance-CloudHubandAnypointStudio]]
== CloudHub and Anypoint Studio

CloudHub is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS). It allows you
to deploy sophisticated cross-cloud integration applications, create new
APIs on top of existing data sources, integrate on-premise applications
with cloud services, and much more. With Anypoint™ Studio – the
user-friendly development tool – you can quickly build these integration
applications and deploy to CloudHub with just a few clicks. This guide
will help you learn the basics and get started developing your first
applications.

=== CloudHub and the Anypoint Platform for APIs

CloudHub was recently unified with the Anypoint Platform for APIs, which
brings many benefits for customers including single sign-on across both
products, more powerful access management capabilities such as
individual roles per environment, and a consistent user experience with
the rest of the Anypoint Platform. If you are an existing or previous
CloudHub customer and want to know about how these changes affect your
account and deployments, see
the link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+R40+Migration+Guide[CloudHub
R40 Migration Guide].

[[CloudHubataGlance-MuleFlows]]
== Mule Flows

The underlying configuration for your CloudHub integration is a "Mule
Flow". Mule flows are made of individual components called Message
Processors. These components act as the building blocks for your
integration. As you build your flow with message processors, you are
defining how "messages" – or data-content – flows from one component to
the next.

As an example, a CloudHub integration can monitor, or poll, your
Salesforce instance for any changes across all of your accounts. When a
change occurs, the integration converts the changed data to a CSV file,
and then uploads the file to your on-premises SFTP site. The Mule flow
would contain three Message Processors and look like this:

These flows are quickly assembled inside Mule Studio with just a few
clicks and pieces of configuration. In just a few minutes you can have a
complete working integration between your SaaS services and your
on-premise systems.

[[CloudHubataGlance-MessageProcessors]]
== Message Processors

Message processors allow you to do almost anything: connect to SaaS
services, transform data, connect to various protocols, filter data, and
much more. Each message processor has an icon in the Mule Studio Palette
so you can drag it inside of your flow and configure it. Message
processors fall into one of six categories, and are easy to locate in
the Mule Studio Palette within their appropriate category:

Category

Description

link:/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Connectors[Anypoint
Connectors]

Anypoint™ Connectors connect via protocols or to SaaS services and
on-premises applications such as as Salesforce, MongoDB, CMIS, NetSuite,
Magento, Intacct, and many more systems. For a full list, see our
http://www.mulesoft.org/connectors[list of connectors].

link:/documentation/display/current/Transformers[Transformers]

Transformers help you change from one data format to another. Use
transformers out-of-the-box, or add scripts using your favorite
scripting language.

link:/documentation/display/current/Scopes[Scopes]

Scopes provide advanced processing, such as asynchronous invocations,
polling, sub flows, and more.

link:/documentation/display/current/Components[Components]

Components allow you to write reusable business logic with Java, or a
scripting language, and also create or invoke web services.

link:/documentation/display/current/Filters[Filters]

Filters determine how messages can proceed through your Mule flow.

link:/documentation/display/current/Routers[Flow Controls]

Flow Controls allow you to route messages to different locations –
whether another flows or different external service. They operate on
collections of data, and can broadcast messages, and more.

[[CloudHubataGlance-DataMapping]]
== Data Mapping

While Anypoint DataMapper is technically a message processor, it
deserves special mention here. It's responsible for helping you map
different data formats - whether it's data from cloud services, or file
formats like CSV, JSON, Excel files, or XML. It makes data integration a
snap with it's easy to use drag and drop interface.

[[CloudHubataGlance-Applications]]
== Applications

Flows are packaged into applications, and then deployed to CloudHub.
It's nearly an automated process from within Mule Studio, as Anypoint
Studio handles the packaging and upload of your application. You can
build, deploy and run your integration without ever leaving Anypoint
Studio.

[[CloudHubataGlance-CloudHubManagementConsole]]
== CloudHub Management Console

Once your application is deployed to CloudHub's multi-tenant runtime,
you can http://cloudhub.io/login.html[log in] to CloudHub's management
console. It allows you to triage problems, view logs, set up alerts,
view dashboards, and more. Follow the simple steps in the
link:/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub[Hello
World] tutorial to setup your free CloudHub account, and then log in to
the console.
