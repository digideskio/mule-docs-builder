= CloudHub Console Overview

Hi Steven!

The CloudHub Console provides point and click access to your integration
applications running on CloudHub. Once logged in, you can perform the
following operations:

* Create and deploy a new application
* Manage an existing CloudHub application
* View application log data
* Monitor message statistics for your application

Before accessing the CloudHub Console, you must
first link:/documentation/display/current/Creating+an+Account[create an
account]. After you have an account, you can log into CloudHub from
the https://cloudhub.io/login.html[CloudHub login page].

Creating an application is the first step to
link:/documentation/display/current/Deploying+a+CloudHub+Application[Deploying
a CloudHub Application]. Each application must have a unique application
domain. If you use the
link:/documentation/display/current/Command+Line+Tools[Command Line
Tools] or Mule Studio, you do not need to perform this step using the
console. After you create at least one application, you will see your
applications listed here, including the number of transactions and the
percentage of CPU usage over the past hour.

Next to each application name, you can see an icon that represents the
current status of the application. The meaning of the status icons is
summarized below:
