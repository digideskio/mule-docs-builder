= Getting Started with CloudHub

CloudHub is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS). It allows you
to deploy sophisticated cross-cloud integration applications, create new
APIs on top of existing data sources, integrate on-premise applications
with cloud services, and much more. With Mule Studio – the user-friendly
development tool – you can quickly build these integration applications
and deploy to CloudHub with just a few clicks. This guide will help you
learn the basics and get started developing your first applications.
