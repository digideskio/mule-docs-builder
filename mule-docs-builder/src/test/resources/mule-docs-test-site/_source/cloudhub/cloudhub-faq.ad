This topic answers frequently asked questions about CloudHub.

== General

=== What is an iPaaS?

As the name suggests, iPaaS is a development platform for building
integration applications. It provides a set of services and capabilities
for integrating applications in the cloud and within the enterprise. The
core tenets of iPaaS are the same as PaaS, except the services on the
platform are geared towards integration. In addition to some base
expectations such as multi-tenancy, elasticity and reliability, iPaaS
also provides intermediation of data and events, orchestration, a
service container for publishing REST and SOAP services, strong security
capabilities, and monitoring and developer tooling. A full description
can be found
http://blogs.mulesoft.org/introducing-integration-paas-ipaas/[here]. +


=== What is CloudHub?

CloudHub a cloud-based integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that
enables developers to integrate and orchestrate applications and
services while giving operations the control and visibility they require
for mission-critical demands, all without the need to install or manage
middleware or hardware infrastructure. Read more about the CloudHub
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Architecture[architecture].


=== Where can I get Anypoint Studio?

Anypoint™ Studio can be
http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-studio-cloudhub-download[downloaded here].
From Studio, you have ability to deploy directly to CloudHub or run your
applications locally on an embedded Mule runtime.


=== How much does CloudHub cost?

You can find the self-service pricing
http://www.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/cloudhub-pricing[here]. If you have
higher message volumes or need different support SLAs, please contact us
at cloudhub-support@mulesoft.com.


== Concepts


=== What is a Worker?

Applications that expose real time services or APIs run on one or more
"workers". Each worker is an instance of Mule that runs your integration
applications.
See link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Fabric[CloudHub Fabric]
for details of how workers can be shared or doubled to scale your
application and provide high availability.


=== What is an Integration Application?

An integration application is one that integrates two or more
applications or services. This may be as simple as synchronizing
Salesforce.com data to a local database to creating a mashup using
Google Apps, Facebook, and Salesforce.com. These applications perform
functions by grabbing data from different sources and publishing it to a
new location or as a REST or Web Service. In the traditional 3 tier
application model an integration app represents the data tier through
connectivity to application data and the service tier through logic used
to combine, transform and route this data to consumers.


=== What is an Anypoint Connector?

Anypoint™ Connectors provide a simple and easy way to integrate with
SaaS and Cloud APIs such as Salesforce, Facebook, AWS, Paypal, and then
to use them as services within Mule. With these connectors you are then
able to create orchestration that spans both SaaS and on-premises
applications, using Mule.


=== What is a Mule Flow?

A Mule flow defines how Mule will processes messages between different
applications. A flow defines a series of processors that will act on a
message triggered by an event in an application, a request to a Web or
REST service or a scheduled trigger.


=== Technical / Troubleshooting


=== What Java version are you using?

Workers which use Mule 3.5.1 and above run on JDK 7. Workers which use
Mule 3.5.0 and below run on JDK 6.


=== How much storage does each worker have?

Each worker has 2 GB of storage for applications to use.


=== Can I get a static IP for my application?

Yes! Please
link:/documentation/display/current/Community+and+Support[contact our
support] to enable this for your application.


=== What are environment variables?

Environment variables are properties you can set to pass in
configuration to your Mule application. For example, you could create a
JDBC connector where the username is set to `${db.username}`. In the
environment variables you could then set the name to `db.username` and
the value to the actual username when you add or update your
application.


=== Can I deploy my application to a different region?

Yes! Please
link:/documentation/display/current/Community+and+Support#CommunityandSupport-Support[file
a support case] to enable global deployments for your account. CloudHub
applications can be deployed to the following regions: US (East), US
(West), Europe (Ireland), and Asia-Pacific (Sydney). Administrators
can link:/documentation/display/current/Managing+CloudHub+Specific+Settings[set
the default region] on the Organization tab in Account Settings, but
that region can be adjusted here when the application is deployed, if
necessary.

Note that applications deployed to Europe will automatically have their
domain updated to `http://myapplicationdomain.eu.cloudhub.io`.
Similarly, applications deployed to Australia will automatically have
their domain updated to `http://myapplicationdomain.au.cloudhub.io`. 


=== I get "Failed to bind to uri" when my application starts

If you're seeing messages like this:

It's because you're trying to bind to a specific host instead of
"localhost". Change your endpoint URLs to use "localhost" instead of
your CloudHub domain name and redeploy.


=== How do I stop my application?

In the CloudHub Console, select your application, then click
*Deployment* in the left navigation bar. Click **Stop application**.


=== Why can't I deploy more than one application?

We're limiting the Free accounts to one worker, which allows you to
deploy one application. You can upgrade to
a http://www.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/cloudhub-pricing[paid subscription]
to deploy more applications or scale your single application across more
than one worker.


=== My application has deployed successfully, but when I go to
mysubdomain.cloudhub.io, I see "you need to change the configuration of
your docroot."

If you are seeing this message, that means that your application's
endpoint could be configured to show up in a different path. If you
would like to make it show up at mysubdomain.cloudhub.io,
please reconfigure your endpoint to remove the path variable. If you are
using generic endpoints, you should change the address (not the path).


=== How long is the HTTP read timeout?

Our load balancers will timeout after 5 minutes if no data is read.
