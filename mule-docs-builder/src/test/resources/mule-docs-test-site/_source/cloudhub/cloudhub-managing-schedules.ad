= Managing Schedules _ _

The CloudHub console includes a *Schedules* tab in the left navigation
menu where you can view and control any polling elements within the
flows of your deployed applications. CloudHub automatically detects the
polling elements from within your flows and lists them on the Schedules
tab. On this tab, you can select the polling elements and enable or
disable them, change the polling frequency, or run them immediately –
all during runtime, without making any changes in the underlying
application.

[[ManagingSchedules-UseCases]]
== Use Cases

The Schedules tab is especially useful for the following use cases:

* You have a job that runs nightly but you want to trigger it right now
so you can debug it. You want to do this in runtime so you don’t need to
update the schedule in your underlying application.
* You want to change your schedules in your application at runtime
without redeploying.
* You want to disable a scheduled job while one of the applications you
are connecting to is undergoing maintenance.
* You want runtime visibility into the schedules in your application.  +

== Viewing Application Schedules in the Console

To use the scheduling feature in CloudHub, deploy an application that
includes one or more polling elements. For example, the application
illustrated below includes two simple flows, each with a polling scope.

Because CloudHub synchronizes your schedules automatically, overriding
any synchronize property set on the flows containing the polling scopes,
there is no need to do any other special configuration. 

Once it is deployed, select the application in your CloudHub console,
and click *Schedules* in the left navigation menu. CloudHub lists the
polling elements in your application in the order that they appear in
your application:

**Note**: The name of each element is determined by the
`doc:name` attribute in the polling scopes, if you add one in the XML.
If you do not specify a `doc:name`, then CloudHub applies the
name, **yourFlowname Poll**.

The *Last Run* column shows the exact date and time when each polling
element ran most recently. You can view the Logs to see further details
about when the jobs started and ended their scheduled runs.

To manage the polling elements:

1.  Check the boxes next to the individual elements that you want to
manage.
2.  Click *Run now* if you want to override the schedule and run that
job immediately.
3.  Click *Disable* to suspend a polling element. CloudHub does not run
the polling job until you *Enable* it once again.
4.  In the **Schedule **column, CloudHub lists each polling element's
polling frequency. +
1.  Click the frequency of a polling element to open the schedule
editor: +
