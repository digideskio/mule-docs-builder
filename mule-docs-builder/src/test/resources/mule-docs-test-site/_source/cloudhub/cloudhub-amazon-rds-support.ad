You can easily integrate your CloudHub application with MySQL or Oracle
using Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). Refer to the
http://aws.amazon.com/rds/[Amazon RDS documentation] to learn how to set
up a new database.

Before using CloudHub with Amazon RDS, you must configure RDS security.
This allows Mule to speak to Amazon RDS. To configure RDS security:

* Log into the https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home[AWS Console].
* Go to the RDS tab.
* Select "DB Security Groups" in the left hand navigation.
* Select the security group for your database instance.
* In the bottom pane, select "EC2 Security Group" in the Connection Type
column.
* Enter "ion-mule" as the security group and "494141260463" as the AWS
Account ID.

You will now be able to use the JDBC connector inside your CloudHub
application with RDS!
