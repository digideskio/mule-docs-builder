== Accessing Different Environments

Your username controls which environment you're accessing and is of the
form `user@environment`. For example, if your username is joe and you
have an environment called "Development", your username is
`joe@Development`. If you don't specify an environment, it defaults to
`production`.

The first time that you create your application, a `cloudhub.properties`
file creates with all of the additional parameters (location of your
file, number of workers, and all system properties). Each time you
update your application, these properties  automatically load from the
`cloudhub.properties` file.
