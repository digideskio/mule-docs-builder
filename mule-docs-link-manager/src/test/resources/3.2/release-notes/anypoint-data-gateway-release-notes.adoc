*_Version 1.1.0_*

=== Features and Functionality

==== Cloud Extender

Cloud Extender is an agent that will enable you to connect to your on-premise data source during the trial period without undergoing VPC configuration to evaluate the product. Cloud Extender relays data between Data Gateway and the data source within the private network through an SSH over HTTP tunnel. The advantage of Cloud Extender is that it eliminates the need to open ports in your firewall and that it configures itself automatically — all you have to do is run it.

==== UX/UI improvements

Several minor UI/UX fixes and improvements:

* Object edition buttons were moved into the object details view
* Synchronization against Salesforce is performed only for the profiles assigned to the current user
* Improved connection creation experience

==== Support for Mule ESB 3.6.1

This version works on top of the latest version of the Mule ESB.

==== Known Limitations

The same limitations of <<1.0.0, v1.0>> apply to this version.
