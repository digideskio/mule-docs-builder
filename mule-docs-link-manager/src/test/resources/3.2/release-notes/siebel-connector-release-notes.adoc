Version

|*Mule Runtime* |v3.6.1 or higher
|*Siebel* |v8.1
|===

[CAUTION]
The Siebel v2.1.0 connector is built and tested using Oracle Siebel 8.1. Because the Java Data Bean interface is generic, the Siebel v2.1.0 connector works with Siebel versions 7.7, 7.8, and 8.0. However, the compatibility of the connector with any other version beside 8.1 has not been tested. The connector is not compatible with Siebel v7.5 and earlier.

=== Version 2.1.0 Features

* Added native library support for Mule projects created in Anypoint Studio without Maven. This lets you add the required Siebel JAR files from the Global Element configuration without using Maven, or installing the JAR locally and adding the dependency to the Project Object Model (POM).
* Migrated to Anypoint Connector DevKit v3.6.1.
