=== Known Issues in the July 2014 Release

==== Localhost Behavior

Please note that defining an endpoint using localhost has important behavior implications for on-premises deployments of APIs and proxies. Refer to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/localhost-behavior-on-the-api-gateway[Localhost Behavior on the API Gateway] for details.

==== Limitations

* The REST APIs for the Anypoint Platform for APIs are not currently exposed publicly for customer use.
* It is not possible to visit the Developer Portal or any public API Portals when signed in as a user of a different organization.
* Developers cannot currently revoke their contracts with API Versions, only API Version Owners have the ability to revoke and delete contracts.
* API Portals cannot currently be deleted.
* Throttling and Rate Limiting policies do not currently work for APIs or proxies deployed to multiple API Gateway workers in CloudHub.
* It is only possible to register new applications from a portal for a specific API version rather than globally from the main Developer Portal page.
* Batch approval of applications is not currently supported.
* Copying content from one API Version to another is not currently supported.
* The IP Whitelisting and IP Blacklisting policies do not function for endpoints defined with the Jetty transport.
* Session timeouts occur after a three-hour window irrespective of user activity.

==== Key Differences for Users Migrating from Previous Versions

If you have an existing Anypoint Platform for APIs account on a previous version, you will need to migrate to this version during the migration period. Please be aware of the following major differences between the previous versions and the July 2014 release.

* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/anypoint-platform-for-apis-glossary[Terminology] has changed to standardize around APIs and applications rather than services and consumers.
* Each API version now has only a single endpoint. 
* The administrative view of your API version (called the API Version Details page) is now accessible only to API Version Owners or Organization Administrators. The Developer Portal, containing the API Portals that you create and share, now acts as the developer-facing view of your API.
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-runtime-policies[Policy application] has been streamlined to a single step for each policy. Contract enforcement and related policies have been replaced with client ID and secret enforcement. SLA-based policies now incorporate client ID and secret enforcement automatically.
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/browsing-and-accessing-apis[Application management] flows have changed. You can now set SLA tiers for automatic approval to reduce your management overhead. Manual approval is also available.
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/viewing-api-analytics[Analytics] are now available only to Organization Administrators.
* Taxonomies, policy characteristic tags, and environments are deprecated.
* API Designer is now accessible through the API Version Details page rather than in the Developer Portal.
