[TIP]
Upgrading from an existing instance of Anypoint Studio or previous Mule runtime version? Refer to the Migration Guide.

This release also supports the Mule ESB 3.6.1 runtime which addresses a critical security issue.

== Migration Guide

This section presents configuration considerations you may want to adjust when migrating from a previous version of a Mule runtime, or previous version of Studio. Contact MuleSoft if you have a question about a specific migration activity or concern.

[NOTE]
====
Because the base version of Eclipse used by Anypoint Studio has changed from 3.8 to 4.4 (Eclipse Luna) in the January 2015 release of Studio, Studio *cannot be updated* from versions that are older than the January 2015 release. If that's the case, you must download and install the latest version.

If you already have the last version of Studio (January 2015) no special migration considerations are needed, use *Help > Check for Updates*.
====

* If you are upgrading from Studio 5.0.0 to 5.1.0, you can update Studio. If you are upgrading from an earlier version, you will need to download the latest version and create a new version. This step is required because of the changes to Eclipse, as described in the note above.

[NOTE]
If you are using Studio as a plugin to Eclipse, it will only work with Eclipse version 4.3 or 4.4 due to a dependency on Maven SWT.

* APIkit 1.5.1 only works in runtimes whose versions are older than 3.6.0. APIkit 1.6.0 works in the 3.6.0 runtime and above (see JIRA STUDIO-5955).
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Java 7] is required for Anypoint Studio. If you are deploying to Java 6 runtimes, you can continue to configure Java 6 as the Java runtime for your project.

[TIP]
To replace the deprecated HTTP connector for the new link:/mule-user-guide/http-connector[high-performance HTTP Connector], refer to link:/mule-user-guide/migrating-to-the-new-http-connector[Migrating to the New HTTP Connector].

If you wish to install a previous runtime or a community runtime, follow the instructions to add additional runtimes to your new instance of Studio.

== APIkit Considerations

[IMPORTANT]
This version of Anypoint Studio requires Java 7. Java 6 is not supported, and Java 8 is not supported by the Mule 3.6.0 Runtime or later.

For most use cases, Anypoint Studio January 2015 with 3.6.0 Runtime does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Anypoint Studio October 2014 with 3.5.2 Runtime. MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4 GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM. Please contact MuleSoft with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Deprecated in this Release

Nothing has been deprecated in this release.
