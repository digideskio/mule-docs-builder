= Mule 3.5.0 Andes Release Notes 
:keywords: release notes, esb


July 23, 2013

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of **Mule 3.5.0** **Andes. ** Focusing on the tools that improve developer productivity, Mule 3.5.0 Andes makes on-premise and SaaS integration even easier. 

Our new version of Studio now functions as a single download with two runtimes:

* Mule 3.4.0 Enterprise runtime - available for deployment on-premise and CloudHub
* Mule 3.5.0 Andes runtime - available for deployment on CloudHub

These release notes apply to Studio and the Enterprise runtimes of Mule 3.5.0 Andes. Note that the new features and functionality in Andes that are not design time features are only available for deployment in CloudHub using the Mule 3.5.0-andes runtime. If you intend to deploy your application to an on-premise production server, use a Mule 3.4 runtime when you begin a new project in Mule Studio. Access link:/documentation/display/34X/Home[Mule 3.4 documentation] for details and read our http://blogs.mulesoft.org/climbing-mountains-faster/[blog post] to learn more about our new release strategy for CloudHub and Mule ESB.

== New Features and Functionality

* **link:/mule-user-guide/datasense-query-language[DataSense Query Language]:** Mule's new SQL-like query language allows you to easily query and retrieve complex metadata from remote applications, saving you the effort of manually discovering which data types and fields are available to query. Use Studio's graphical *link:/mule-user-guide/datasense-query-editor[query editor]* to quickly assemble a query on an Anypoint Connector which supports query functionality.
* **link:/mule-user-guide/working-with-multiple-versions-of-connectors[Work with Multiple Versions of Connectors]**: Rather than bluntly forcing all your applications to use a single version of a connector, you can arrange to download and use multiple versions of the same Anypoint Connector on your instance of Studio.
* **Improved Source Control Integration:** If using **http://git-scm.com/[git] **to keep track of changes in an application, you can use Studio to link:/mule-user-guide/preparing-a-gitignore-file[prepare a standard gitignore file] for a new Mule Project.
* **link:#[Properties Editor]:** We've been working on usability! By default, Mule Studio's Visual Editor enables you to double-click a building block on the canvas to open its Properties Editor pop-up**;** optionally, you can now adjust the Preferences in Mule Studio to display the Properties Editor as a tab in the console
* link:/mule-user-guide/deploying-to-multiple-environments[*Project Environment Settings*]: Throughout the different phases in the development lifecycle you may wish to deploy an application to multiple different environments, such as Production, QA and Test. You can configure your Mule application to facilitate deployment to one of many different environments, both on-premise and in the cloud.
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis-administration/managing-cloudhub-environments[*CloudHub Sandboxes:*] CloudHub includes the ability to create *sandboxes*, restrictive environments for developers and testers to safely test applications without the risk of affecting the production environment.
* *link:/mule-user-guide/poll-reference[Watermarks]:* Easily keep track of the last record or time that you've sync'd without writing custom logic when extracting data from a system like Salesforce.
* **Anypoint Connectors Compatibility:** All connectors available on MuleSoft's http://www.mulesoft.com/cloud-connectors-full[Anypoint Connectors website] are compatible with Mule 3.5.0 Andes runtime, although not all connectors support DataSense. Refer to the complete list of link:/mule-user-guide/using-perceptive-flow-design[DataSense-enabled] connectors.
* *CXF Upgrade to 2.5.9*

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Mule 3.5.0 Andes does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Mule 3.4.0. Please mailto:support@mulesoft.com[contact MuleSoft] with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Important Notes and Known Issues in this Release

This list covers some of the known issues with Mule 3.5.0 Andes. Please read this list before reporting any issues you may have spotted.

=== Mule Studio

[cols=",",]
|===
|STUDIO-3490 |Multiple versions of connectors, problem when trying to load libraries. +
*Workaround*: First install the connectors that you have in your project in Mule 3.5.0 Andes. Next, go to the path where your project is located, look for the .classpath file and open it with any text editor. Remove the entries that refer to those Connectors. Save the changes to the text fiel, then import the project in Studio. After the project is imported, add the connector libraries to the project again by right clicking the connector in the package explorer, and selecting Add libraries to project classpath.
|STUDIO-3495 |If deleting an element inside a poll, the cannot receive new elements. +
*Workaround*: Delete the poll message processor, then drag a new poll message processor onto the canvas. 
|STUDIO-3479 |When updating the Default expression in the Properties Editor of the Choice Flow Control, the branches in the Choice representation on the canvas don't update until you access the Configuration XML view, then return to the canvas. +
Workaround: Save your project, then access the Configuration XML view. Return to the canvas.  
|SE-266 |DataMapper does not maintain the sequence of elements when imported from XSD.
|STUDIO-3494 |Debugger does not stop on breakpoints in flows built for APIkit.
