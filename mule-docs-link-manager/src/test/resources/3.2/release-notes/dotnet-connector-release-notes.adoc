== Version 2.0.2 - April 3, 2015

This release has the same compatibility and features as version 2.0.0 and adds the following fixes:

* It is now possible to pass a Map with a null property value to a .NET method and have the arguments mapped without error. In previous versions it was necessary to use a JSON data structure to map properties with null values, or an exception would be thrown.
* After a call into the .NET Connector, flow variables and message properties that contained complex types (POJO and HashMap) were being overwritten. These properties are now preserved and return unmodified after execution of .NET code.

[NOTE]
If you are using the .NET Connector SDK in addition to the .NET Connector, you should update the assembly reference to the version in the link:/documentation/download/attachments/123338982/dotnet-connector-sdk.zip?version=1&modificationDate=1428086506273[dotnet-connector-sdk.zip]. For more information, see http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/DotNet+Connector+User+Guide#DotNetConnectorUserGuide-MuleContext[Mule Context] in the link:/mule-user-guide/dotnet-connector-user-guide[DotNet Connector User Guide].


== Version 2.0.0 - January 21, 2015

We are pleased to release the .NET connector v2.0. We've made several enhancements to the connector in this release as well as an important bug fix.

The link:/mule-user-guide/dotnet-connector-guide[Anypoint Connector for DotNet (.NET)] lets you integrate .NET code written in any language into your Mule Project. Code is executed in-process for high performance, and full debugging support is available using Visual Studio.

=== Version 2.0.0 New Features 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Feature |Description
|*Anypoint Studio* |Support for the Anypoint Studio January 2015 release and Mule 3.6, allowing the user interface for each supported assembly that references method to be specialized, exposing only the configuration properties required for that scheme.
|*Accessibility to methods from within Studio* |Users can now browse the methods contained within the assembly they are referencing right within Studio, allowing them to choose the exact method signature to invoke rather than typing the method name. This makes setting up a call to .NET code much simpler and error-free. Selecting an exact method also gives more information to Studio about the expected data types both in and out, which lets Mule more accurately map and validate the data types as the message passes through the flow.
|*Full DataMapper Support* |The .NET connector now provides full DataMapper support, allowing you to get deep visibility into the structure of objects received and returned by .NET methods. Simply dragging a DataMapper component before or after the .NET connector onto the flow designer presents a detailed view of the properties available for mapping, and you can wire up calls using the full array of auto-mapping or expression based mapping features provided by DataMapper.
| *Support for Mule logging and events* |Get detailed insight into the behavior and performance of .NET components in a Mule flow by leveraging the Mule logging and events system. Custom events can be started from within the .NET component via the instrumentation framework, and messages logged directly to the Mule console for debugging purposes.
|*Support for advanced integration scenarios* a|
The .NET connector now enables additional advanced integration scenarios. By referencing the Mule .NET integration assembly, you can access the Mule message directly to manipulate the payload, inspect inbound and session properties, and modify outbound properties.

|Issue |Resolution
|*Array type payloads not mapped correctly to method signatures* |This issue has been fixed. Array type payloads generated by the scatter-gather process are now supported and correctly mapped into compatible method signatures when selected.

=== Version 2.0.0 Upgrading to DotNet Connector 2.0

The .NET connector 1.x and 2.x versions cannot be run side-by-side in the same Anypoint installation. For migration guidance and tooling to assist in the process of moving from 1.x to 2.x and beyond, refer to the link:/mule-user-guide/dotnet-connector-migration-guide[DotNet connector migration guide].

== Version 1.0 - July 23, 2014

 The Anypoint Connector for DotNet (.NET) lets you execute native .NET code in a Mule ESB application.  This connector executes .NET code using the Java Native Interface (JNI), which provides interprocess communication between the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a native application running in a host operating system.

=== Version 1.0 Compatibility

 The .NET connector is compatible with:
