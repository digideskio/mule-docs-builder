= Extending Components

There may be cases which call for extending Mule components. (we have link:/mule-user-guide/developing-components[Developing Components] for this)

This can be fairly straightforward, such as implementing your own transport or filter. (see link:/mule-user-guide/creating-transports[Creating Transports])

How can you write your own transformers, filters, etc. +
 Basic extending mule (primarily filters and transformers)

Extending Mule components may mean something more advanced, including creating custom routers or even implementing custom exceptions strategies. (we have link:/mule-user-guide/creating-custom-routers[Creating Custom Routers] for this)

Custom components, custom routers, exceptions strategies (rarer) +
 implementing your own connectors, other advanced topics

(current - impl your own transports)
