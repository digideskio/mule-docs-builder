In the New Enterprise, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) play a key role in synchronizing and streamlining communication between applications. But elegant, well-designed APIs don't code themselves – building a good API eco-system in an enterprise requires tools, helpful constraints, and guidelines to enforce good design practices and maximize the productivity of time spent coding. A development team with such tools is empowered to *code faster*, *test efficiently*, and provide practical, *useful documentation* for end-users.

Enter RAML and APIkit.
