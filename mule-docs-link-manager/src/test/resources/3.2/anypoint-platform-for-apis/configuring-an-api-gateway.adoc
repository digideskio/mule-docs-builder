= Configuring an API Gateway

[NOTE]
Looking for a basic introduction to the API Gateway? See the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/api-gateway-101[API Gateway 101] for answers to some frequently asked questions.

The *API Gateway* points to the backend APIs and services that you define and abstracts them into a layer that the Anypoint Platform for APIs manages. Consumer applications that invoke your services and APIs route to the endpoints that the gateway exposes to enforce runtime policies and collect and track analytics data. The API Gateway is available for on premises (your site) that you can download from http://www.mulesoft.com/ty/dl/api-gateway[here], or a cloud version. For more information, see "Setting Up Your Gateway" below.

*Licensing Note* :  API Gateway only supports MuleSoft HTTP, Jetty, File, JDBC, and WS-Consumer connectors. The  API Gateway does not support MuleSoft batch components. In order to utilize other connectors or batch components you must license Mule ESB Enterprise.  

The API Gateway provides two benefits:

. The gateway acts as a dedicated orchestration layer for all your backend APIs to separate orchestration from implementation concerns.
. The gateway lets you take advantage of the governance capabilities of the Anypoint Platform for APIs so that you can apply throttling, security, and other policies. +

== Choosing a Gateway Option

MuleSoft offers two options for the API Gateway: on premises (at your site) or in the cloud. Both the on-premises and cloud API Gateway options are specially configured versions of Mule runtimes. In both options, the gateway runtime includes functionality that enables communication with the Anypoint Platform for APIs, including support for link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/api-auto-discovery[API auto-discovery]. The API Gateway also has endpoint protocol limitations. For more information about the limitations, please contact Support by filing a ticket in the Support portal, linked from the top navigation bar in the Anypoint Platform.

The on-premises API Gateway is available for download http://www.mulesoft.com/ty/dl/api-gateway[here]. Select this option if you would like to install and manage an API Gateway behind your firewall. MuleSoft works with you to size the installation and provide a license for the API Gateway. 

The cloud API Gateway is powered by CloudHub, MuleSoft's integration platform as a service (iPaaS). Select this option if you don't want to install and maintain any MuleSoft software for your gateway.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Java 7 Required* +

Note that all versions of the API Gateway (including the version you can run inside Anypoint Studio) require *Java 7*. Java 8 is not supported at this time.

If you do not have Java 7 installed on the machine running the API Gateway, http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html#jdk-7u55-oth-JPR[download it] before proceeding.
====

== Security

The Anypoint Platform for APIs agent packaged with the gateway interacts with the Anypoint Platform for APIs via a client ID and client secret, which can be accessed by an Organization Administrator. Configure the client ID and client secret in the gateway before the gateway can connect with your Anypoint Platform for APIs organization. Read more about link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/anypoint-platform-for-apis-system-architecture[how the API Gateway works with the agent].

== Configuring Anypoint Studio for Integration with Your Anypoint Platform Organization

Before you configure your production gateway, you may want to configure Anypoint Studio to work with your Anypoint Platform organization for testing. First, you'll need to download the API Gateway runtime from the Studio Update Site.

. Under the `Help` menu in *Anypoint Studio*, select `Install New Software`. 
. In the **Work with:** field in the Install wizard, enter +
 `https://studio.mulesoft.org.s3.amazonaws.com/r3/api-gateway/`
.  Check the box next to *API Gateway runtime*, then click *Next*.
.  Follow the remaining steps to accept the installation. +

If you use this runtime when working with APIkit projects and API proxies, you can test connectivity with the platform and test any governance that you have applied to the endpoints. +

Next, configure your client ID and client secret in Anypoint Studio:

. Obtain your client ID and client secret from an Organization Administrator for your Anypoint Platform for APIs organization. 
+
[NOTE]
To obtain these, log in to the Anypoint Platform as an administrator, click the gear icon at the top-right and then select the Organization tab.
. Open Anypoint Studio.
. Click *Anypoint Studio* > *Preferences*, and click the arrow next to *Anypoint Studio* to expand the node.
. Click *Anypoint Platform for APIs*.
.  In the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields, paste the unique values for your organization. +
. Leave the Host, Port, and Path defaults as they are and click *OK*.  

Your instance of Anypoint Studio is now set up to communicate with the Anypoint Platform for APIs.


== Setting Up Your Gateway

=== On-Premises Gateway [TAB]

==== Downloading Files

. First, unless you have already done so, download the latest version of  *http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-studio[Anypoint Studio]* . Anypoint Studio gives you access to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/building-your-api[APIkit], which you can use to build new APIs. You can also use it to modify or create proxy applications for your existing APIs.
. Next, http://www.mulesoft.com/ty/dl/api-gateway[download a standalone API Gateway runtime]. Use this API Gateway instance for your production deployments.

==== Configuring Your Production API Gateway for Integration with the Anypoint Platform

Next, install and configure your production API Gateway.

[IMPORTANT]
Before proceeding, refer to the link:/documentation/display/current/Hardware+and+Software+Requirements#HardwareandSoftwareRequirements-APIGateway[Hardware and Software Requirements] and work with mailto:support@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft support] if you need assistance.

. Obtain your client ID and client secret from an Organization Administrator for your Anypoint Platform organization.
+
[NOTE]
To obtain these, log in to the Anypoint Platform as an administrator, click the gear icon at the top-right and then select the Organization tab.
. Open the  `wrapper.conf` file in your `<MULE_HOME>/conf` folder.
+
[TIP]
` <MULE_HOME> ` is the value of the MULE_HOME variable employed by MuleSoft's *API Gateway*, usually the root directory of the installation, such as `/opt/Mule/api-gateway-1.3.0/`.
. Paste the following code as a new item at the end of the list in your file:  +
+
 `wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.client_id=<PasteYourUniqueValueHere>`
 `wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.client_secret=<PasteYourUniqueValueHere>`
+
Replace the value of  `<` `n>`  with the next incremental values over the previous entries in the list, then replace < `PasteYourUniqueValueHere>`  with the client ID and client secrets for your organization.

[NOTE]
====
If you prefer, you can pass the token via the command line when starting the gateway instead of adding it to your `wrapper.conf` file.

Start your gateway from the command line by running the following command:

**Mac/Linux/Unix**:

[source,xml]
----
<MULE_HOME>/bin/gateway -M-Danypoint.platform.client_id=<PasteYourUniqueValueHere> -M-Danypoint.platform.client_secret=<PasteYourUniqueValueHere>
----

*Windows*:

[source,xml]
----
<MULE_HOME>\bin\gateway.bat -M-Danypoint.platform.client_id=<PasteYourUniqueValueHere> -M-Danypoint.platform.client_secret=<PasteYourUniqueValueHere>
----

The above commands start your gateway in the terminal foreground. To run the gateway in the terminal background, include the `start` parameter as the first parameter to the `mule` command. In this case, to stop the gateway, run `gateway stop` or `gateway.bat stop`.
====

==== Obtaining and Installing Your Enterprise License

If you are using a trial Anypoint Platform for APIs account, you can follow all the steps above without installing a license for trial purposes. The trial download of the API Gateway includes a 30-day trial license. However, for production deployments of the gateway, you need a license for your API Gateway instances. Contact your account representative or file a support ticket to obtain your license file.

Follow these steps to replace your trial license file with an Enterprise license for production use.

. If you haven't already done so, contact MuleSoft to acquire an *Enterprise license* in the form of a `license.lic` file.
. If you are installing your license on multiple platforms, back up your new `license.lic` file in another location before proceeding.
. Open the terminal or command line on your system.
. For Mac/Unix/Linux, from the `<MULE_HOME>/bin `directory. Run the following command:    
+
`gateway -installLicense <path>/license.lic`
+
(Replace `<path>` with the full or relative path to your license file.)
+
For Windows, first copy the  `license.lic`  file into the  `<MULE_HOME>\bin` folder. Then  `cd` to that directory and run the following command: +
+
`gateway -installLicense license.lic`
. The gateway removes the temporary trial license and replaces it with the Enterprise license. In the `<MULE_HOME>/conf` directory, the gateway saves a new file called `muleLicenseKey.lic`
. The gateway starts running automatically after you install the license.

=== Cloud Gateway [TAB]

First, unless you have already done so, download the latest version of  *http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-studio[Anypoint Studio]* . Anypoint Studio gives you access to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/building-your-api[APIkit], which you can use to build new APIs. You can also use it to modify or create proxy applications for your existing APIs.

[IMPORTANT]
If you want to automatically deploy to CloduHub, you must do it on the same Anypoint Platform account where you have your API Gateway, and your user must have the appropriate permissions both on CloudHub and on the API Platform.

. In your API Administration page, click *Configure Endpoint* under the API Status section
. Tick the box labeled *Configure proxy for CloudHub*.
+
image:configuring-an-api-gateway-2.png[image] +
+

Notice that, when ticking the box, the *Port* field changes.
. Under *Advanced settings*, you can change the *API Gateway Version*if you wish. Otherwise, by default you will use the latest.
.. You can tick the box labeled *Deploy after saving* ** to go straight to the deploy menu. Otherwise, click Save and deploy when you're ready. +
Notice that after configuring the proxy for CloudHub, a new link labeled *Deploy proxy* appears in the *API Status* section. Use it to open the deploy menu.
+
image:configuring-an-api-gateway-3.png[image]
.. In the deploy menu, submit an app name and choose an environment. The Gateway version is selected from what you configured on the Configure Endpoint section.

+
image:configuring-an-api-gateway-4.png[image]

+
[TIP]
A link will then be provided to the actual CloudHub application for further management, from there you can then change the worker type, the environment, set advanced settings, etc. Under the API Status section, a new link will appear labeled *Manage CloduHub proxy* that takes you there.
. The status of the API deployment is indicated by the marker in the API Status section of the API version page. While the app is starting, you will see a spinner. Once it starts successfully, the light will turn green. +

+
[TIP]
Notice there should now be a new link under the API Status labeled **Re-deploy proxy**, click it in case you make changes to the proxy configuration. You don't need to redeploy in case you add or apply policies, SLA tiers or permissions, as those changes will take effect automatically.

==== Manual Deployment to CloudHub

===== Logging In to Your CloudHub Account

* https://cloudhub.io/login.html[Log in] to CloudHub. If you haven't already done so, create an account now.

===== Deploying Applications to CloudHub with Your Organization's Client ID and Client Secret

. Obtain your client ID and client secret from an Organization Administrator for your Anypoint Platform organization.
+
[NOTE]
To obtain these, log in to the Anypoint Platform as an administrator, click the gear icon at the top-right and then select the Organization tab.
. When you deploy or update an already deployed application on CloudHub, include your client ID and client secret as environment variables. Open the *Advanced* section and define two Environment Variables with your Anypoint Platform client ID and client secret, which you can obtain from an Organization Administrator. (For help with the location of the Advanced section, see link:/cloudhub/deploying-a-cloudhub-application[Deploying a CloudHub Application].) In the *Name* field, enter `anypoint.platform.client_id`, and in the *Value* field, enter your organization's unique `client_id`. Then, define a second environment variable by clicking the plus icon for a new line. In this line's *Name* field, enter `anypoint.platform.client_secret`, and in the *Value* field, enter your organization's unique client secret.
. Make sure that when deploying your application, you pick the runtime *Gateway 1.3* (or a higher version of the Gateway runtime) in the the *Mule Version* field.
. Once your application successfully deploys, any endpoints within your application are tracked by the Anypoint Platform for APIs agent in CloudHub.

[NOTE]
====
*Summary* +

For all endpoints that you register in Anypoint Platform for APIs that point to proxies running on CloudHub, specify your host and port names according to the CloudHub standards. For the HTTP or HTTPS connector, specify the host as *localhost* and the port `${http.port}` in your application. Need more detail? See the link:/cloudhub/developing-a-cloudhub-application[directions]. In Anypoint Platform for APIs, replace `localhost` and `${http.port}` with the domain that you select for deployment.

Thus, you must configure information both in Anypoint Platform for APIs and in the underlying applications in the API Gateway for the agent to track your application in CloudHub.

* In the Anypoint Platform for APIs, use the same domain to which you deployed the application on CloudHub, with any additional paths.
* In your proxy applications that you deploy to CloudHub, set your host to `0.0.0.0` and your port to `${http.port}`.

If you plan to expose your API through SSL, then there are a couple of link:/cloudhub/building-an-https-service[additional steps] you need to take.

== Configuring a Load Balancer

If you are deploying your APIs or API proxies to an on-premises API Gateway and are using an HTTP load balancer to manage traffic, you need to configure the load balancer endpoints in your wrapper.conf file so that the API Gateway can correctly associate your load balancer endpoint to your API endpoints. Note that if you are deploying to a cloud API Gateway, the load balancer configuration is handled for you.

Open your wrapper.conf file and add `anypoint.platform.manual_alias` pairs, numbering each pair with an integer, in sequence. Note that the integers for this group of properties start over at `0`. In each pair, the first property ends with the  `.from` value and the other with the `.to` value:

[source,java]
----
anypoint.platform.manual_alias.0.from=http://localhost:8080/foo
anypoint.platform.manual_alias.0.to=http://www.myloadbalancer.com/foo
anypoint.platform.manual_alias.1.from=http://localhost:8081/bar
anypoint.platform.manual_alias.1.to=http://www.myloadbalancer.com/bar
----

In each case, the "from" URL is your actual API or proxy endpoint and the "to" URL is your load balancer endpoint.

== Configuring Cache Size

Versions 1.3.2 and above support adding the system property `http.dispatchersCacheSize`, which allows you to specify the size of the dispatcher's cache for routing outbound requests targeting dynamic URLs.

The default value is 6000. This value can be tuned to improve performance for cases that have high concurrency and large URL variability. Take into account that changing this value will probably require a larger amount of Heap Memory.

== Using the API Gateway

You can use the API Gateway to proxy your existing services with HTTP/HTTPS, Jetty, or Web Service Consumer connectors to the Anypoint Platform for APIs, wherever they are implemented. You can also include selected additional connectors, as specified in your subscription plan. Please contact your account representative for details about allowed connectors. If you need to proxy other kinds of endpoints, such as JMS, WebSphere MQ, Anypoint Connectors, or any other endpoint protocols, please talk to mailto:sales@mulesoft.com[your sales representative] about upgrading your installation to a full Mule ESB or CloudHub account, so that you can take advantage of the full suite of endpoints and message processing capabilities of the Anypoint Platform.

Because the API Gateway acts as an orchestration layer for services and APIs implemented elsewhere, it's technology-agnostic. You can proxy non-Mule services or APIs of any kind, as long as they expose HTTP/HTTPS, or endpoints for Jetty or a Web Service Consumer. You can also proxy APIs that you design and build with API Designer and APIkit to the API Gateway to separate the orchestration from the implementation of those APIs.

Refer to the link:/mule-user-guide/[Mule User Guide] or the link:/cloudhub/[CloudHub Documentation] for reference information about using your API Gateway, keeping in mind the previously described usage restrictions.
