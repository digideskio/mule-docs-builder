= Applying Runtime Policies

This page covers how to apply and unapply governance policies to your API version at runtime.

== Assumptions

This page assumes that you have API Version Owner permissions for the API version that you are trying to manage. You must link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/setting-your-api-url[have an endpoint declared] for your API version before you can apply policies.

[IMPORTANT]
Note that policies can only be enforced by the Anypoint Platform for endpoints that are registered on an link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/configuring-an-api-gateway[API Gateway]. Thus, while you can apply and unapply policies at any time after link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/setting-your-api-url[setting your API URL], you must link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/deploying-your-api-or-proxy[deploy your API or a proxy application to your API Gateway] before those policies can be enforced.

== Available Policies 

[NOTE]
Note that all the policy templates below are intended only for HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. If your API uses a Jetty inbound endpoint, all policies below will function as expected except for the rate-limiting and throttling policies. These policies will not work due to a limitation of the Jetty transport. If your API requires rate-limiting or throttling, please ensure that its inbound endpoint uses the HTTP transport protocol.

The Anypoint Platform for APIs includes the following out-of-the-box policy templates.

|*link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate Access Token Enforcement]* |Security |Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid PingFederate token. Note that this policy is only available to organizations using a PingFederate Federated Identity Management system. + |OAuth 2.0 Protected |None |1.0
|*link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis-administration/setting-up-external-identity[OpenAM Access Token Enforcement]* |Security |Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OpenAM token. Note that this policy is only available to organizations using an OpenAM Federated Identity Management system. |OAuth 2.0 Protected |None |1.3.2
|*IP Whitelist* |Security |All API calls are limited to to a defined set of IP addresses. |IP Filtered |None |1.0
|*IP Blacklist* |Security |API calls from a defined set of IP addresses are denied. |IP Filtered |None |1.0
|*JSON Threat Protection* |Security |Protects the target API against malicious JSON that could cause problems. |JSON Threat Protected |None |1.0
|*XML Threat Protection* |Security |Protects the target API against malicious XML that could cause problems. |XML Threat Protected |None |1.0
|*Throttling – SLA-Based* |Quality of Service |The number of messages per time period processed by an API is throttled at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing. Enforcement is based on the client id passed in the request.  |Throttled |None |1.0
|*Throttling* |Quality of Service |The number of messages processed by an API per time period is throttled at a maximum value specified in the policy. The throttling is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing. |Throttled |None |1.0
|*Rate Limiting – SLA-Based* |Quality of Service |The number of messages per time period processed by an API is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected.

|*Rate Limiting* |Quality of Service |The number of messages processed by an API per time period is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the policy. The rate limiting is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected. |Rate Limited |None |1.0
|*link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/accessing-your-api-behind-a-firewall[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing]* |Compliance |CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) is a standard mechanism that allows JavaScript XMLHttpRequest (XHR) calls executed in a web page to interact with resources from non-origin domains. CORS is a commonly implemented solution to the "same-origin policy" that is enforced by all browsers. This policy enables all origins, and makes all resources of an API public. |Same-Origin Policy Enforcement |None |1.1
|*Client ID Enforcement* |Compliance |All calls to the API must include a valid client id and client secret. |Client ID Required |None |1.0

== Applying and Removing Policies

After you have declared an endpoint for your API version, the three management tabs on your API version details page become active: Applications, Policies, and SLA Tiers.

To apply a policy to your endpoint:

. Click *Policies* to view the list of available policies for your organization. 
. Select individual policies to read their descriptions. When you have found the one you want to apply, click *Apply.*
. Depending on the policy that you have selected, you may need to provide further configuration. See detailed instructions for configuring the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/ldap-security-manager[LDAP policy], the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/oauth-2.0-provider-and-aes-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[AES-based OAuth policy set], or the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate Policy].

If the policy that you wish to apply has a disabled *Apply* link, it is not eligible to be applied to your endpoint. Either:

* you already have another policy applied which fulfills the same requirement (see the Fulfills column) +
or
* the policy that you want to apply requires that another policy be applied first (see the Requires column)

To unapply policies, click *Remove*. The policies are immediately removed from your endpoint. Note that if you wish to reapply the policy, you need to configure it again. Your previous configuration is not saved.
