= Creating Your API in the Anypoint Platform

Before you can design, manage, or publish your APIs in the Anypoint Platform, you have to create them in the platform. You can do this from the *API Administration page*, which you should have access to if you are a member of the API Creator or Organization Administrator role.

== Assumptions

This page assumes that you have an Anypoint Platform for APIs account and that you are a member of either the API Creator role or the Organization Administrator role. If you are not in one of these roles, ask your Anypoint Platform Organization Administrator to add you to the API Creator role so that you can create APIs.

== Creating an API

To create a new API in the platform, click *Add New API* from the API Administration page.

Fill out a *Name*, *Version*, and brief *Description* for your API, then click *Add API*. The name cannot exceed 42 characters in length.

The platform uses this information to create an administrative command center for your API, your *API Version Details page*. From here, you can design your API with RAML, create a portal for your API to engage with developers, and set your APIs URI so that you can manage it, either directly – if your API itself is deployed to the API Gateway – or through a proxy deployed to the gateway.

[TIP]
If you want to migrate or copy an existing API Version, you can http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Copy+of+Managing+API+Versions[export the existing API] to a .zip file and then import it into a new API Version.
