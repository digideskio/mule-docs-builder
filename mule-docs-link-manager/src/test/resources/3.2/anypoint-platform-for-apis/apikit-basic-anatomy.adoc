= APIkit Basic Anatomy

As an interface between applications, an API's job is to open small windows in an internal system through which external systems can access particular bits of data and perform actions with the data, mainly POST, DELETE, GET, and PUT. For example, Twitter's API makes it possible for other organizations to tap into internal data and use it in specific ways, such as GETting data about the number of tweets concerning a #topic. APIkit makes it easier to implement the REST interface that enables external users to access your data, then integrate it with backend processes to function as an API. 

This document explores the basic anatomy of APIkit and how the parts work together to become a REST API. 

== Assumptions

This document assumes you are familiar with some of the design decisions and requirements for creating a REST API. It assumes you are familiar with an integrated development environment (IDE) and that you have a basic understanding of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[REST] as a Web service paradigm. Don't let these assumptions stop you from reading further – APIkit may help bridge any troublesome knowledge gaps with which you're struggling.

== Basic Anatomy

As a relatively simple-to-use construct, there are three main parts of APIkit which are combined to form a REST API: 

. Interface 
. Main flow
. Backend flows

=== Interface

The *Interface* is, as the name suggests, the mediator between the service exposed to the world, and the internal assets that need to be exposed.

As the definition of the API, its job is to designate the resource(s) which either contain or access the data assets. Essentially, the interface is the part of the API that defines the data to which end users have access, and specifies the actions against the data you wish to make available through your API (GET, PUT, etc.). In APIkit, this relationship is known as a "resource-action pairing."  Use RESTful API Modeling Language (http://raml.org/[RAML]) to define your interface, then import the interface (which manifests as a .raml file) into Anypoint Studio with APIkit. Once imported, APIkit uses the content of the RAML file as the *API Definition* (i.e. the API's interface).

====
*Limitations*

RAML offers a broad range of functionality for defining APIs. APIkit is designed to work very tightly with RAML interfaces, but, out of the box, does not currently automatically import the following items from the RAML definition:

* https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/08_security.md[securitySchemes]
* https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/04_basic_information.md[protocols]
* https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/04_basic_information.md[baseUriParameters]
====

=== Main Flow

The *Main flow* manages three critical functions:

. it exposes the API via HTTP or Jetty
. it routes requests between the interface (defined in RAML) and the backend flows (defined in XML)
. it references exception strategies specially designed to produce HTTP-status-code-friendly responses

Essentially, this flow is where you "wire everything together", enabling the API to accept requests and send responses, and facilitating communication between the interface and the processes which do its bidding. In Mule, the Main flow in your config file handles the calls and routing. See example below.

----

Within the application's config file, you can also define the API's exception strategies so that the backend flows "know" that when a message throws a certain type of exception, the error response must be delivered in an HTTP-status-code-friendly format. When a request cannot find a resource, for example, it should respond with a proper 404 error indicating that "The resource cannot be found"; the *APIkit exception strategies mappings* manage the return of such HTTP-status-code-friendly responses. Referenced within the main flow via an exception-strategy element, you define the actual exception strategy behavior outside the flows in the application. See the example below.

[source,xml]
----
<apikit:mapping-exception-strategy name="apiKitGlobalExceptionMapping">
        <apikit:mapping statusCode="404">
            <apikit:exception value="org.mule.module.apikit.exception.NotFoundException" />
            <set-property propertyName="Content-Type" value="application/json" />
            <set-payload value="{ &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Resource not found&quot; }" />
        </apikit:mapping>
        <apikit:mapping statusCode="400">
            <apikit:exception value="org.mule.module.apikit.exception.BadRequestException" />
            <set-property propertyName="Content-Type" value="application/json" />
            <set-payload value="{ &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Bad request&quot; }" />
        </apikit:mapping>
    </apikit:mapping-exception-strategy>
----

=== Backend Flows

The *Backend flows* do the "heavy lifting" of actually performing the actions the interface defined.

For example, where an API's interface enables an end user to GET a list of teams in a particular league, the backend flow mapped to that action in the interface accesses a database to look up a list of teams in a league, then provides the response to the request. In Mule, you build flows to perform the backend work to support the API's interface.  

=== Console

Beyond the three above-listed parts of an API, there is a fourth part – technically, not a part of the REST API itself – that APIkit exposes when you deploy the API: the** Console**. 

Not only does it document your API so that it is consumable and usable by application developers, APIkit can help you test your newly built API to ensure that it functions as intended. You can use your browser to point at the URL configured in your API Definition to access the auto-generated, fully testable documentation for your API. Through a Web-based user interface, you can browse all the actions your API supports – GETting this, POSTing that – and send test calls to your API to solicit responses. In addition to using it for testing, you can expose the console as API documentation, so that end users of your API have an excellent resource for learning how to consume your API. See the example below.

== How it Works

The following outlines the high-level steps an APIkit-built API takes to process end user requests.

image:apikit-basic-anatomy-4.png[image]

. End user sends an HTTP request to the API.
. The HTTP or Jetty endpoint in the main flow receives the request; passes the message to the APIkit Router.
. The router checks with the interface to confirm that the resource-action pair exists in the interface.
. The router checks to see if a body is defined as part of the request (generally, a request sends a body only with PUT, POST, and PATCH requests).
. If the request includes a body, the router determines the media type (or MIME type) associated with the body, then matches the request content type with the one defined in the interface.
. If a schema is defined for the content type, the router checks that the schema on the incoming request matches the schema defined in the interface (i.e. schema validation). If the request does not match, the application rejects the request.
. The router uses the information contained in the interface to determine to which backend flow it should route the request. Based on the request and the resource-action pairing in the example above, the router determines that it should send the request to flow2.
. The router sends the request to flow2.
. Flow2 processes the request, accessing a resource and acting upon data as required.
. Flow2 returns a response to the router.
. The router pushes the response to the HTTP or Jetty endpoint.
. The HTTP or Jetty endpoint sends the response to the end user.
. From the console, a developer can simulate the steps above by submitting requests via the Web user interface. +


== Strengths of APIkit

When you combine *RAML* with **Anypoint Studio** and the Mule extension that is *APIkit*, you've set yourself up with a powerful environment for quickly assembling REST APIs.

_Assembling_ is a key concept of APIkit as it involves less line-by-line coding and more "aligning the pieces of the puzzle" to quickly build an API with which you can interact almost immediately. Essentially, Anypoint Studio with APIkit presents you with a suite of tools with which you can assemble the pieces of a REST API puzzle – a RAML file constructed to define resources, an out-of-the-box router to map defined resources to backend flows, and backend flows pieced together to access the resources – so you don't have to plod through weeks of coding to yield something useful and testable. Just build it, test it, tweak it, then deploy it. 

Further, APIkit leverages a scaffolding plugin to save you a step in building your API. Rather than building your backend flows manually in Studio, you can auto-generate flows based upon the content of the API definition (i.e. RAML file). With the skeleton of all the backend flows in place, all you need to do is fill in a few configuration details, then hit save and run.

[TIP]
If you want to migrate or copy an existing API Version, you don't need to go through all these steps. You can simply http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Copy+of+Managing+API+Versions[export the existing API] to a .zip file and then import it into a new API Version.
