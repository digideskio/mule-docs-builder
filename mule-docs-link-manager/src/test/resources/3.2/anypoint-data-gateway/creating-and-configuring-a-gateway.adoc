= Creating and Configuring a Gateway
:version-info: 3.6.0 and later
:keywords: data gateway, salesforce, sap, oracle

== Overview

You create and manage gateways through the Anypoint Platform Designer, where you can perform actions such as:

* View, add or modify gateways
* Configure connections and VPC
* View gateway logs

== Creating a New Gateway

To create a new gateway, click *Add Gateway*. The Anypoint platform takes you through the creation process via four screens:

* link:#CreatingandConfiguringaGateway-conf.prop[Configure Properties]
* link:#CreatingandConfiguringaGateway-apply.pol[Apply Policies]
* link:#CreatingandConfiguringaGateway-setup.gate[Validate & create]
* link:#CreatingandConfiguringaGateway-validate.gate[Publish Gateway]

=== Configuring Properties

The gateway creation wizard first displays the *Configure Properties* screen, shown below. Here you define the following parameters:

* The connection to use. You can select from existing connections (such as *SAP* in the image below) or configure a new connection
* A name for the gateway
* A description for the gateway

=== Configuring a New Connection

If you select to configure a new connection, the wizard prompts you to select from the available connection types, as shown below.

Click the desired connection type. The wizard displays a connection parameters configuration window. The image below displays the configuration parameters for Oracle.

[TIP]
Click the *Test Connection* button to test the connection before creating it.

==== Configuring a New Connection for SAP

There are a few requirements for connecting Data Gateway to SAP; these are described below.

===== SAP Libraries

When configuring a new SAP connection, you need to have the SAP library files available on your local machine. The connection configuration window will prompt you to upload the libraries necessary for a SAP connection:

* SAP IDoc JCo Library (sapidoc-x.jar)
* SAP JCo Library (sapjco-x.jar)
* SAP JCo Native Library (libsapjco-x.jar)

Download these SAP libraries from the official SAP https://websmp109.sap-ag.de/connectors[download site]. You need a SAP user ID to download.

For more information on SAP libraries, refer to the http://help.sap.com/saphelp_nwpi711/helpdata/en/48/70792c872c1b5ae10000000a42189c/content.htm?frameset=/en/48/707c54872c1b5ae10000000a42189c/frameset.htm&current_toc=/en/b4/3f9e64bff38c4f9a19635f57eb4248/plain.htm&node_id=444&show_children=false[SAP help portal].

===== Required Function ModuleÂ `Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE`

In order to deploy a gateway to an environment, function module `Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE` used by Data Gateway must exist in the SAP instance. If the module is present in the SAP instance, then no action is necessary.

Depending on the specific version of SAP, the function module may be called `/BODS/RFC_READ_TABLE` or `/SAPDS/RFC_READ_TABLE`. If the SAP instance contains one of these two modules, copy it into a new module named `Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE`.

If the SAP instance does not contain any of the above-listed function modules, then you must create function module `Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE`. Depending on the SAP solution and/or release, it may possible to install the module in accordance with SAP Note 1752954. If this SAP note is not applicable for your specific SAP solution and/or release, then you must implement the function module from the provided SAP transport (see files `D900237.EH6` and `K900237.EH6`). See SAP Note 1802544 for a reference on how to deploy the SAP transport. If it is not possible to import the transport into the SAP instance, then create the function module manually from the provided source code (see file `Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE.abap`).

Note that in all cases the `Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE` module must be available on all SAP instances which will be accessed by Data Gateway.

=== Applying Policies

In the *Apply Policies* screen, you set the gateway authentication parameters and optionally apply throttling.

Hover your mouse over the question mark icons image:creating-and-configuring-a-gateway-1.png[image] for tooltips.

==== Basic Authentication

Allows you to set the values for the login credentials for the gateway. You can optionally click *Generate Password* to have a password created for you.

==== Throttling

This optional setting limits the max. number of messages that an API can process per millisecond. Throttling is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Messages that exceed the established limit are queued for later processing. The available parameters are:

* *Delay Time in Milliseconds:* The amount of time that responses will be delayed after the SLA has been exceeded
* *Delay* *Attempts:* Number of attempts to process the request before fully exhausted
* *Maximum Requests Per Period:* Number of requests to allow per specified time period

=== Setting Up the Gateway

When you click *Next* at the *Apply Policies* screen described above, the Anypoint platform sets up the gateway you've just defined, but does not yet create or publish it. The process can take a few minutes. Do not close your Web browser or navigate away from the page until the process is complete.

After the process is finished, the wizard displays the *Validate & Create* screen, shown in the section below.

=== Validating, Creating and Publishing the Gateway

image:creating-and-configuring-a-gateway-1.png[image]

To publish the gateway in Salesforce, click *Publish Now*.

At this point, you have set up, created and published your gateway, and are ready to populate it with objects. For details on creating an object, see *Creating a New Object* in link:/anypoint-data-gateway/managing-gateways[Managing Gateways].
