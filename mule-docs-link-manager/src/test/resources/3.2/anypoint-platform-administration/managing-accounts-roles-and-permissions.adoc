== Assumptions

This page assumes that you have an Organization Administrator role in your organization, that you have been assigned as the administrator of one of the Sub-organizations of your Organization, or that you have API Version Owner permissions in at least one sub-organization and that you want to manage user permissions for an API version.

== How Permissions Work in the Anypoint Platform

In the Anypoint Platform, users belong to an organization and have a set of roles and permissions. Roles and permissions can be granted at the level of the master organization, or they can also be granted at http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Managing+Sub-Organizations[sub-organization﻿] level. A user that owns any role in a sub-organization is implicitly granted membership in the sub-organization.

API versions and CloudHub deployment environments are grouped under organizations or sub-organizations, to access them you need to have an account that that owns the necessary permissions and that belongs to its corresponding organization – and to the sub-organization if the resource exists in one. Each role contains a list of permissions that define what a user that holds that role can do within the specific organization or sub-organization. Permissions can also be added at an individual user level, without the need for roles.

There are two different types of permissions: those that are for API versions and those that are for CloudHub environments. Keep in mind that API permissions are API version specific and CloudHub permissions are environment specific – they grant you the ability to do something within a particular API version / environment, not the entire organization. The only exceptions to that rule are the roles *API Version Owner*​ – which grants ownership of all APIs and all of their versions within the sub-organization – and *Portals Viewer*​ – which grants viewing access to all portals in the sub-organization.

== Updating Your Name, Email and Password

Once logged in, select *Your Profile *on the top right menu.You can easily update your basic account information from here:

image:managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions-1.jpeg[image]

There you'll be able to modify your name, email, change your password and see a list of the roles assigned to your account.

== Manage the Organization's Users

[IMPORTANT]
_Admin Only_

As an Admin of your organization, you can enable, disable, or delete the users in it, as well as invite people to register a new Anypoint Platform account associated to your organization. Access this menu by clicking the gear icon next to your user name at the top of the screen and then picking the appropriate link in the left menu.

image:managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions-2.jpeg[image]

By ticking the checkbox next to a user, a few more options related to that user will be displayed, specifically *enable*, *disable* and *delete*.

You can then invite other users to join the organization you've created in the Anypoint Platform by clicking the green *Invite Users* button. In that way they will potentially have access to the same set of resources as you (although they may have different roles that can restrict what they can view or do). They will receive an email inviting them, and if they click through the link they will be presented a sign-up form that already has the *Company* field completed, matching your organization.

image:managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions-3.jpeg[image]

You can also pick the *Pending Invites* tab to view invitations that have been sent but that haven't been confirmed by the users yet.

By clicking on a username in the table below, you can access more information about that user, add roles and permissions to it, or reset its password.

image:managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions-4.jpeg[image]

To add roles or permissions to a user, pick the corresponding tab, then:

* For API Permissions: write the name of the API you want to give access to, then pick a version and permission
* For CloudHub Permissions: write the name of the CloudHub environment to want to give access to, then pick a permission
* For Roles: write the name of the role you want to grant

Then fill in the necessary fields and commit your choice by clicking the green checkmark.

If necessary, you can also remove user permissions. Note that if users have been granted their permission via a role, you cannot view or remove those role-based permissions here, you must do it via the *Roles* section of the menu.

== Manage Roles

[IMPORTANT]
_Admin Only_

As an Admin of your organization, you can create or delete roles, define what permissions each grants, and what users own it. Access this menu by clicking the gear icon next to your user name at the top of the screen and then picking the appropriate link in the left menu.

image:managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions-5.jpeg[image]

Click the Add Role button to add a new role. Once created, you can look for it on the table and click on it to add permissions, API resources, and users to it. By ticking the checkbox next to a role, the delete button will become visible.

These are the default roles available in every new organization when created:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
a|
Role Name
 a|
Description
|API Creators |Create and manage API versions in the Anypoint Platform for APIs. This role grants no permissions on CloudHub.
|Cloudhub Admin |Access to all CloudHub functionality.
|Cloudhub Developer |Access to all CloudHub functionality, except organization and billing settings.
|Cloudhub Support |Read-only access to dashboards, notifications, alerts, logs, and their user settings.
|Organization Administrators |Editing access to all versions of all APIs, all registered applications, and all API Portals in the Anypoint Platform. Access to the Organization Administration page, where they can add and manage users and roles, view and edit organization details, access the client ID and client secret for the organization, and customize the theme of the Developer Portal.
|===

The user who first signs up for the Anypoint Platform organization is known as the Organization Owner. This is not a role but an identifier for this single user, who inherits the Organization Administrator role by default.

If you click on a role, you can edit it. Change its name or description, add or remove permissions – both for API resources and CloudHub environments, and add or remove users to it.

=== CloudHub Permissions

There are two ways to assign CloudHub permissions. One way is to add them to Anypoint Platform roles, and then assign those roles to users. The other is to assign permissions directly to individual users in the Users menu previously described.

To add CloudHub permissions to a role do the following

. Pick the Cloudhub Permissions tab
. Click in the green region labelled *Add an environment by name*
. Type in the name of one of the environments existing in your organization
. Then you will be able to select what permissions to grant within that environment. You can also pick *Select All* to assign all permissions related to that environment to that role.

[NOTE]
Note that CloudHub permissions are each specific to a single environment, so if you have multiple environments and want to give a role the same permissions on all, you must add these permissions multiple times, one for each environment.

You can also assign CloudHub permissions directly to a specific user (not a role), you can do this by going to the *Users* menu, selecting a user, and then following the same steps as above. Note that the user must already be a member of your organization for you to grant permissions.

=== API Permissions

There are two ways to assign API permissions. One way is to add them to Anypoint Platform roles, and then assigning those roles to users. The other is to assign permissions directly to individual users in the Users menu previously described or from an API version details page.

To add API permissions to a role do the following:

. Pick the API Permissions tab
. Click in the green region labelled *Add an API resource by name*
. Type in the name of one of the APIs existing in your organization
. Then you will be able to select what permissions to grant within what specific versions of that API . You can also pick *All versions* to assign permissions for all current and future versions of that API.
+

You can also assign API permissions directly to a specific user (not a role), you can do this by going to the *Users* menu, selecting a user, and then following the same steps as above. Note that the user must already be a member of your organization for you to grant permissions. As an alternative you can also do the following:

. Navigate to the API version page
. Select the Permissions tab
. Search for a user by name and assign a permission
+
image:managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions-10.jpeg[image]

The types of permissions you can assign for APIs are the following:

* *API Version Owner*: API Version Owners can view specific versions of the API that they own. API Version Owners inherit Portal Viewer permissions by default for any API Portals that you create for the API versions they own.
* *Portal Viewer*: Portal Viewers can see a list of the Private API Portals to which they have Portal Viewer permissions from the Developer Portal. They can also click to view those API Portals. Note that the ability to view an API Portal does not automatically give a user access to the API. Also note that you cannot grant Portal Viewer permissions unless the API has an API Portal.

== Manage your Organization Settings

[IMPORTANT]
_Admin Only_

As an Admin of your organization, you can modify the organization's domain and the session timeout for its users. Access this menu by clicking the gear icon next to your user name at the top of the screen and then picking the appropriate link in the left menu.

image:managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions-11.jpeg[image]

Even though multiple organizations can be created by different users using the same company name, each organization has a unique domain.

Here you can also consult your organization's Client Id and Client Secret. These are useful if you want to use an API Gateway, as you must register it with a specific organization.

You can also set a default timeout for owners of accounts in this organization, so that they have to re-login after a period of inactivity.

== External Identity

The external identity section displays information about your http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity[federated identity] provider (if you have one enabled). Today only Ping Federate is supported for external identity.

You cannot enable this yourself, in order to enable federated identity, you must contact support.

Once implemented, the external identity section will display the corresponding configuration settings.
