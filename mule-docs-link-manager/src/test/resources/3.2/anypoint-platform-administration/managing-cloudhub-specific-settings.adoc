= Managing CloudHub Specific Settings
:keywords: anypoint platform, permissions, configuring, cloudhub

Some of the settings for managing your Anypoint Platform account are specific to CloudHub, this document explains these in more depth.


== Managing Regions

[IMPORTANT]
_Admin Only_

If Global Deployment is enabled on your account, you can also set the *Default Region*. The region set here will auto-populate in the Advanced Details on the deployment screen for all applications deployed by users in your organization, but it can be adjusted at the application level if necessary for individual deployments.  Access this menu by clicking the gear icon next to your user name at the top of the screen and then picking the *General* link, under *CloudHub* in the left menu.

[NOTE]
If you don't currently have Global Deployment enabled on your account but would like it, please file a ticket in the http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Community+and+Support#CommunityandSupport-Support[support portal].

== Managing Environments

[IMPORTANT]
_Admin Only_

CloudHub gives you the ability to create separate environments for deploying, these are independent from each other. Environments can either be of *production* or *sandbox* type. By default, when creating a new organization you will have one production environment named "Production".

Sandbox environments are helpfully restrictive environments for developers and testers, they facilitate safe testing of applications without the risk of affecting the production environment.

For example, you can create a sandbox environment for a QA team in which they can test new releases of applications before deploying in production. You can add users to a sandbox environment without permitting them to access the production environment, thereby securing production and eliminating the risk of a developer accidentally operating upon an application in production. Once you are sure the app is safe to expose to your users, you can then easily promote an app from a sandbox environment to a production environment.

To create or manage environments, access the corresponding menu by clicking the gear icon next to your user name at the top of the screen and then picking the *Environments* link, under *CloudHub* in the left menu.

To add an environment, simply click the green *Add environment* button. To rename one, click on its link in the table below it. You can't grant users access to an environment directly, you must do it through the use of roles. To grant a role permissions to access your new environment, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis-administration/managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions[Managing Accounts Roles and Permissions].

[NOTE]
Depending on the type of subscription you have on CloudHub, you may be restricted to creating a limited amount of each kind of environment.

For more on managing environments see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis-administration/managing-cloudhub-environments[Managing CloudHub Environments].

== CloudHub Subscription

When you first sign up for CloudHub, you're automatically added to the Free plan (subscription level). In order to upgrade to one of the paid plans, please contact your account executive or cloudhub-support@mulesoft.com.

To see your subscription level and usage, click the gear icon next to your user name at the top of the screen and then pick the *Subscription* link, under *CloudHub* in the left menu.

The image below shows sample subscription and usage information for an Enterprise account. The bar graphs indicate that this account is using two out of four available workers in Production, and none out of possible four for Sandbox environments. Also, this account has two out of the five available applications deployed to the Production environment, none out of the possible five in the Sandbox environments. +

[NOTE]
*Workers != Applications* +
Note that there is not a 1:1 relationship between workers and applications. If you have link:/cloudhub/cloudhub-fabric[CloudHub Fabric] enabled on your account, applications can be deployed to shared workers, allowing one worker to handle the load of multiple low-volume applications. Additionally, applications can be deployed to multiple or double workers for increased processing power. For more information about worker sizing, see link:/cloudhub/deploying-a-cloudhub-application[Deploying a CloudHub Application].

== Changing Your Plan

To change your plan, please contact your account representative or file a support ticket.
