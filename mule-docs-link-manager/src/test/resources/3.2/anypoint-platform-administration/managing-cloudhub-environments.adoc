= Managing CloudHub Environments
:keywords: anypoint platform, permissions, configuring, cloudhub

CloudHub gives you the ability to create separate environments for deploying, these are independent from each other. Environments can either be of *production* or *sandbox* type. By default, when creating a new organization you will have one production environment named "Production".

Sandbox environments are helpfully restrictive environments for developers and testers, they facilitate safe testing of applications without the risk of affecting the production environment.

For example, you can create a sandbox environment for a QA team in which they can test new releases of applications before deploying in production. You can add users to a sandbox environment without permitting them to access the production environment, thereby securing production and eliminating the risk of a developer accidentally operating upon an application in production. Once you are sure the app is safe to expose to your users, you can then easily promote an app from a sandbox environment to a production environment.

== Switching Environments

Once you have multiple environments in your organization, you can switch between them. If you're on any screen of the CloudHub platform, you can switch to a different environment by clicking on the current environment name, displayed in the top right corner of the screen, then picking the desired environment.

== Migrating an App to Production

Once you have created an app in a sandbox environment and tested it out, you will eventually want to migrate it to production. To do so, create a new app in your production environment, then when picking the application file, instead of choosing a file, click *Get from sandbox*.

You will then be able to choose between your sandbox environments and select an app to deploy in production.

=== Limitations

* Only a *CloudHub Administrator* can move applications between environments. 
* To avoid domain name conflict, an application cannot exist in two environments at the same time. Alter the application's name slightly to deploy it to another environment.
* You cannot move an application _from_ Production to another environment. You can move applications between sandbox environments, and _to_ Production, but not from Production to a sandbox environment.
* You cannot move the same application into the same environment. CloudHub prevents you from duplicating applications in a single environment. If you wish to have the same, or similar applications in a single environment, modify one application's file to distinguish it from the original.
* Currently, you cannot delete a sandbox environment via the Web console. If you wish to delete a sandbox, please contact mailto:cloudhub-support@mulesoft.com[CloudHub Support].
