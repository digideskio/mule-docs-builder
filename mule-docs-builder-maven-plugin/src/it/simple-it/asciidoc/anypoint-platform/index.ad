This section describes CloudHub.

== Introducing CloudHub

Integrate SaaS applications, Cloud Services and Enterprise applications
in real-time. CloudHub is the world's first integration Platform as a
Service (iPaaS). CloudHub is built on top of Mule, the most widely used
integration platform.

== Why CloudHub?

=== Start small, think big

CloudHub is an elastic cloud that scales on demand. You can start small
and grow as your needs grow, all without changing your application.
CloudHub provides you with a scalable architecture – one you can build
integration applications on, publish REST APIs or Web Services, and much
more.

=== Rock solid platform

Built on our battle-tested Mule integration platform, Mule ESB is used
by thousands of companies for mission-critical applications. It's the
world's most widely used platform for integration.

=== Integrate your cloud and enterprise applications

The Secure Enterprise Gateway (SDG) provides a secure pipe to the
enterprise, breaking down the "cloud silo." CloudHub allows you to
integrate and orchestrate applications, data sources, and services
across the enterprise and cloud.

=== Unrivaled connectivity

Easily integrate with popular SaaS, cloud, and social media platforms
such as Salesforce.com, Intuit, Authorize.net, Amazon, Twitter,
Facebook, and PayPal using our predefined connectors – then orchestrate
data between these services and the enterprise. Plus, our development
kit allows developers to create new connectors easily. You don't even
need knowledge of the underlying integration infrastructure.

=== Don't change the way you code

Create CloudHub applications with the development tools you are already
familiar with. Download

Studio], it's free! Anypoint Studio is an Eclipse-based graphical
environment that allows developers to easily choose to code in a visual
environment with a palette of components, or in a familiar XML code
view. You can even switch between the visual and code views as you build
your application. Or, if you would rather use the command-line, we
support Maven, as well as a command line tool.

=== Visibility and control with the CloudHub Cloud Console

With CloudHub, you'll also get our intuitive cloud console where you can
manage your applications, scale up and scale down, view event traffic,
and much more. The CloudHub Cloud Console allows you to manage every
aspect of your CloudHub applications from one place.

=== Behind a great platform is a great API

Do you need to automate tasks, or build CloudHub into your deployment
process? CloudHub has a
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+API[REST API] with which
you can perform tasks such as manage and monitor your applications,
scale your applications up or down, and more.
