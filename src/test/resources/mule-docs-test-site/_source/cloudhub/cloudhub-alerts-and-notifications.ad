[[AlertsandNotifications-Overview]]
== Overview

**Notifications **are standard messages that appear in the CloudHub
console to provide status information about your applications. 

*Alerts* give you the ability to trigger emails whenever certain events
related to your application occur.

CloudHub includes several out of the box *standard* *alert* types:

* You exceed a certain number of events processed in a certain time
period
* A deployment completes with success or failure
* The secure data gateway gets connected or disconnected
* CloudHub encounters a problem with the worker on an application via
the link:/documentation/display/current/Worker+Monitoring[worker
monitoring] system

Creating a standard alert will create both a notification in the console
and an alert action (i.e. email to a specific user).

CloudHub also lets you create your own *custom* *alerts* for your
application. Custom alerts are triggered by notifications that your
application sends to the CloudHub console (using the
http://mulesoft.github.io/cloudhub-connector[CloudHub Connector]). For
example, you can send a custom alert when:

* Your application is unable to connect to a remote service
* An error occurs which requires human intervention, such as a problem
with data mapping
* You want to create a summary of what occurred inside your application,
such as the number of orders processed

Custom alerts differ from standard alerts in that you will receive a
notification from your application inside the console UI regardless of
whether you configure an alert.

 

[[AlertsandNotifications-ManagingNotifications]]
== Managing Notifications

Notifications appear by clicking the bell icon in the top-right of the
CloudHub console. If you have new notifications, the bell will turn red.

Each notification has a priority level and a message associated with it.
If the notification is associated with a specific application, the
application name will also be provided.
