= Virtual Private Cloud

CloudHub's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables you to connect to your
corporate data centers – whether on-premises or in other clouds – as if
they were all part of a single, private network. You can configure these
networks to use IPsec or SSL and create them at hardware or software
levels.

[[VirtualPrivateCloud-HowVPCWorks]]
== How VPC Works

The Virtual Private Cloud creates secure connections between CloudHub
and the internal networks behind your firewall, allowing you to create a
secure, virtual private cloud (see image below). Its light-weight
configuration options offer connectivity for mission critical
applications by providing redundant, hardware-level connections which
can scale.

VPC can be configured to use IPSec, SSL (over OpenVPN) or Amazon VPC
peering to connect to your on-premises data centers. IPsec connections
can be configured at the hardware level in addition to a software
client. If you already use Amazon, you should use VPC peering.
Otherwise, IPsec is in general the recommended solution for VPC to
on-premises connectivity. It provides a standardized, secure way to make
connections and integrates well with existing IT infrastructure such as
routers and appliances. 

You can also use OpenVPN to connect networks or hosts to a CloudHub VPC.
Indeed, Open VPN is recommended when any of the following are true:

* You need to connect through a SOCKS/HTTP proxy
* You do not have an IPsec gateway
* You need to implement multiple host-to-network configurations

 

[[VirtualPrivateCloud-VPCTopologies]]
== VPC Topologies

You can connect a Virtual Private Cloud to a datacenter using one of
these topologies:

1.  **IPsec tunnel with network-to-network configuration:** Connect a
network to a CloudHub VPC
with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec[IPsec. +
 +
]
2.  **OpenVPN tunnel with network-to-network configuration:** Connect
network to a CloudHub VPC using an SSL tunnel. +
 
3.  **OpenVPN tunnel with host-to-network configuration:** Connect
multiple hosts to a CloudHub VPC using an SSL tunnel. +
 
4.  *VPC Peering:* Connect an Amazon VPC directly to a CloudHub VPC.

 

These two diagrams illustrate the IPsec and OpenVPN network-to-network
topologies:

The diagram below illustrates a host-to-network topology, which you can
configure via OpenVPN tunnels. In this configuration, CloudHub acts only
as a server and cannot initiate the connection or restart the tunnel if
it goes down.

For this topology, you need to provide a VPN network that does not
overlap with any existing networks in your infrastructure. CloudHub
automatically assigns IP addresses for the tunnel based on the network
you define.

The diagram below illustrates connecting a CloudHub VPC and Amazon VPC
together directly through VPC peering:

[[VirtualPrivateCloud-ConfiguringVPCforYourAccount]]
== Configuring VPC for Your Account

The first step in setting up VPC for your account is to select the
appropriate VPC topology for your use case. Then, contact your MuleSoft
account representative to discuss your specific requirements. 

Once you have selected an option, download
link:/documentation/download/attachments/118981343/VPC+Gateway+Questionnaire+v6.xls?version=1&modificationDate=1413925784546[the
VPC discovery form], then enter data to communicate the necessary
details required for your topology. Once they receive your form and
answer any remaining questions, the CloudHub support team securely
exchanges keys and supplies instructions on how to configure your
router(s).

The SLA for configuring VPC is 5 business days after
link:/documentation/download/attachments/118981343/VPC+Gateway+Questionnaire+v6.xls?version=1&modificationDate=1413925784546[the
VPC discovery form] has been completed and returned, though it may be
completed sooner.

 

[[VirtualPrivateCloud-FrequentlyAskedQuestionsaboutCloudHubVPC]]
== Frequently Asked Questions about CloudHub VPC

[[VirtualPrivateCloud-CanIreusemyexistingAmazonVPC?]]
==== Can I reuse my existing Amazon VPC?

No, but we can set up your CloudHub VPC to communicate with your
existing Amazon VPC.

[[VirtualPrivateCloud-HowdoesVPCworkwithAmazonregions?]]
==== How does VPC work with Amazon regions?

Our VPC solution supports different Amazon regions. During setup, you
need to specify which Amazon region you want. If you need support for
multiple regions, please submit one copy of the discovery form for each
region in which you need support. 

[[VirtualPrivateCloud-CanIhavemultipleVPCsinasingleAmazonregion?]]
==== Can I have multiple VPCs in a single Amazon region?

Yes, this is possible, but not included in our standard setup. Please
contact your account representative to discuss your requirements.

[[VirtualPrivateCloud-HowdoIlimitcommunicationwithmyworkerstomyVPCchannel?]]
==== How do I limit communication with my workers to my VPC channel?

If you have VPC and you don't want your application exposed via the
publicly accessible load balancer at myapp.cloudhub.io, you need to use
8091 or 8092 instead of $\{http.port} or $\{https.port}, respectively,
when deploying your application.

[[VirtualPrivateCloud-HowdoIcommunicatewithmyworkersthroughmyVPCwithoutgoingoverthepublicInternet?]]
==== How do I communicate with my workers through my VPC without going
over the public Internet?

You can communicate with your Mule worker by using
mule-worker-internal-myapp.cloudhub.io as the address in your
configuration. This is a DNS A record which includes the IP addresses of
all your workers.

[[VirtualPrivateCloud-CanIassignanenvironmentaVPCsubnet?]]
==== Can I assign an environment a VPC subnet?

No. While VPCs can be shared across environments, you can not control
what subnet the environment deploys to.
