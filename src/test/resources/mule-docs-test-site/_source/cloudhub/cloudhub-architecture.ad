[[CloudHubArchitecture-CloudHubArchitecture.1]]
== CloudHub Architecture

To understand CloudHub’s approach to security and availability, it’s
important to understand the architecture behind CloudHub. CloudHub
includes three major components: the management console, the platform
services, and the worker cloud. These three components work together to
run your integration applications.

[[CloudHubArchitecture-IntegrationApplications]]
=== Integration Applications

An integration application is any integration that you've built using
Mule Studio. These applications can do everything from synchronizing
data from Salesforce to a database, to publishing a SOAP or REST API, to
creating complex orchestrations of business processes.

For more about creating and deploying integration applications, see
link:/documentation/display/current/Getting+Started+with+CloudHub[Getting
Started with CloudHub] and
link:/documentation/display/current/Deploying+a+CloudHub+Application[Deploying
a CloudHub Application].

[[CloudHubArchitecture-ManagementConsole]]
=== Management Console

The CloudHub management console is hosted at
https://cloudhub.io/login.html[cloudhub.io]. Log in with your
credentials to upload and manage your integration applications at
runtime. The console surfaces useful monitoring information from the
platform services and also works as a comprehensive dashboard for both
application-level and account-level management. 

Administrator account holders can use the management console to add and
manage other users in the organization, define user roles, and create
and manage sandbox environments. 

For more information about the console, see
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Console+Overview[CloudHub
Console Overview]. For more information about using the console for
account management, see
link:/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Platform+Administration[Account
Management].

[[CloudHubArchitecture-PlatformServices]]
=== Platform Services

CloudHub's platform services are responsible for coordinating all
aspects of the platform. They coordinate deployment of applications,
monitor integrations, provide analytics data, store application data,
run scheduled jobs, and more. Many of these services are also exposed
through RESTful APIs. 

For more information about the CloudHub API, refer to the
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+API[CloudHub API
Reference].

[[CloudHubArchitecture-CloudHubWorkers]]
=== CloudHub Workers

Applications on CloudHub are run by one or more instances of Mule,
called **workers**. Workers are a unit of:

* **Capacity**: Each worker has a specific amount of capacity to process
data.
* **Isolation**: Each worker runs in a separate container from every
other application.
* **Manageability**: Each worker is deployed and monitored
independently.
* **Locality**: Each worker runs in a specific worker cloud, the US, EU,
Australia, etc.

Each worker is a dedicated instance of Mule that runs your integration
application. Each worker includes 1.5 GB of memory and 1 virtual core of
processing power. Workers can be scaled vertically by selecting one of
the available worker sizes:

*Worker Size*
*Virtual CPUs*
*Memory (GB)*
Regular
1
1.5
Double
2
3
Shared
Shared workers offer limited CPU and IO for smaller workloads, +
with burst capacity of up to 1 virtual CPU

 

With link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Fabric[CloudHub
Fabric], you can also scale your applications horizontally by adding
multiple workers and load distribution over queues. For more information
about scaling workers, see
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Fabric#CloudHubFabric-WorkerScaleout[Worker
Scaleout]. For more information about using persistent queues on
CloudHub, see
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Fabric#CloudHubFabric-PersistentQueues[Persistent
Queues].

[[CloudHubArchitecture-GlobalWorkerClouds]]
=== Global Worker Clouds

CloudHub offers different worker clouds in different regions of the
world: the United States, the European Union, and Australia. This global
distribution allows you to host your integration in a location that is
closest to your services, thus reducing latency. It may also allow you
to adhere with local laws, such as the EU Data Protection Directive. The
management console and platform services are hosted in the United
States.

When your application is running in the EU, all HTTP services are also
available over the eu.cloudhub.io domain. For example, if you created
the application "myapp", then its domain would be
"myapp.eu.cloudhub.io." This load balancer is hosted in the EU, ensuring
that your data will never be transferred outside the EU when invoking
HTTP services.

For more information about deploying applications to different regions,
refer to the
link:/documentation/display/current/Deploying+a+CloudHub+Application#DeployingaCloudHubApplication-AdvancedApplicationOptions[deployment
guide]. For more information about CloudHub's security and compliance,
download the
link:/documentation/download/attachments/118981856/Anypoint_Platform_Cloud_Security_and_Compliance.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1414221949159[Anypoint
Cloud Security & Compliance whitepaper].

[[CloudHubArchitecture-WorkersandMultitenancy]]
=== Workers and Multitenancy

Because different levels of security and isolation are needed depending
on the service, the platform provides two different levels of
multitenancy.

* First, the worker cloud is a multitenant cloud of virtual machines.
These VMs provide the security and isolation needed for your
integrations to run custom code without affecting others. 
* Second, the management console and the platform services have a
"shared everything" architecture – all tenants share the same web UI,
monitoring services, load balancers, etc. These services do no not
process or transmit your data.

 

[[CloudHubArchitecture-CloudHubAvailabilityandScalability]]
== CloudHub Availability and Scalability

CloudHub has been designed to be highly available and scalable through
redundancy, intelligent healing, and zero downtime updates. It also
provides customers with the ability to scale and have added reliability
through CloudHub Fabric. 

[[CloudHubArchitecture-RedundantPlatform]]
=== Redundant Platform

All of CloudHub's platform services, from load balancing to the API
layer, have at least one, built-in layer of redundancy and are available
in at least two data centers at all times. All data centers are at least
60 miles apart. This redundancy ensures that even if there is a data
center outage, the platform remains available. 

[[CloudHubArchitecture-IntelligentHealing]]
=== Intelligent Healing

CloudHub monitors the worker clouds for any type of problems and
provides a self-healing mechanism to recover from problems. If the
underlying hardware suffers a failure, the platform migrates your
application to a new worker automatically. In the case of an application
crash – whether due to a problem with custom code or a bug in the
underlying stack – the platform recognizes the crash and can restart the
worker automatically. 

For more information about application monitoring and automatic
restarts, see the
link:/documentation/display/current/Deploying+a+CloudHub+Application#DeployingaCloudHubApplication-MonitoringandAutomaticRestart[deployment
guide].

[[CloudHubArchitecture-ZeroDowntimeUpdates]]
=== Zero Downtime Updates

CloudHub supports updating your applications at runtime so end users of
your HTTP APIs experience zero downtime. While your application update
is deploying, CloudHub keeps the old version of your application
running. Your domain points to the old version of your application until
the newly uploaded version is fully started. This allows you to keep
servicing requests from your old application while the new version of
your application is starting.

[[CloudHubArchitecture-CloudHubFabric]]
=== CloudHub Fabric

CloudHub Fabric provides scalability, workload distribution, and added
reliability to CloudHub applications on a per-application basis. These
capabilities are powered by CloudHub's scalable load-balancing
service, http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Fabric#CloudHubFabric-WorkerScaleout[worker
scaleout],
and http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Fabric#CloudHubFabric-PersistentQueues[persistent
queueing] features.

[[CloudHubArchitecture-WorkerScale-OutandDataCenterRedundancy]]
==== Worker Scale-Out and Data Center Redundancy

With CloudHub Fabric, you can add multiple workers to your application
to make it horizontally scale. This also adds additional reliability.
CloudHub automatically distributes multiple workers for the same
application across two or more datacenters for maximum reliability.

When deploying your application to two or more workers, the HTTP load
balancing service distributes requests across these workers, allowing
you to scale your services horizontally. Requests are distributed on a
round-robin basis.

[[CloudHubArchitecture-PersistentQueues]]
==== Persistent Queues

Persistent queues ensure zero message loss and allow you to distribute
non-HTTP workloads across a set of workers. For example, if your
application is deployed to more than one worker, persistent queues allow
interworker communication and workload distribution. If a large file is
placed in the queue, your workers can divide it up and process it in
parallel.

Persistent queues also guarantee delivery of your messages; even if one
or more workers or datacenters go down, persistent queues facilitate
disaster recovery and provide resilience to hardware or application
failures.

For more details about worker scale-out and persistent queues, refer to
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Fabric[CloudHub Fabric].

 

[[CloudHubArchitecture-Security]]
== Security

CloudHub architecture provides a secure platform for your integrations.

Securing your payload data is critically important. To this end,
CloudHub does not inspect, store, or otherwise interact directly with
payload data. CloudHub workers provide a secure facility for
transmitting and processing data by giving each application its own
virtual machine. This ensures complete isolation between tenants for
payload security, and isolation from other tenants’ code. 

CloudHub collects monitoring, analytics, and log data from CloudHub
workers and may perform actions on behalf of the user on CloudHub
workers. All communication between CloudHub platform services and the
worker cloud is secured using SSL with client certificate
authentication. This ensures that unauthorized parties cannot read data
and that they cannot initiate unauthorized actions.

Cloud Security & Compliance whitepaper].
