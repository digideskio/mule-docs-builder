[[ManagingQueues-ManagingQueues ]]
= Managing Queues__ __

The CloudHub console includes a **Queues** tab in the left navigation
menu where you can view and control any Virtual Machine (VM) or Staged
Event-Driven Architecture
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_event-driven_architecture[SEDA])
queues within the flows of your deployed applications.

You can enable **Persistent queues** by clicking **Settings** >
**Advanced**. Thereafter, CloudHub automatically detects the queues from
within your flow and lists them on the Queues tab. On this tab, you can
view the number of queued and in-flight messages on each queue, view a
snapshot of the queue throughput for the past 24 hours, or clear all
pending messages on a queue – all during runtime, without making any
changes in the underlying application.

[[ManagingQueues-UseCases]]
== Use Cases

The Queues tab is especially useful for the following use cases:

* You want runtime visibility into the queues in your application.
* You are testing your application to observe whether messages are
traveling through your queues as expected.
* Your application is stuck processing a particular message and you want
to flush the messages from just that queue to resolve the issue.

 

[[ManagingQueues-EnablingQueues]]
== Enabling Queues

To enable queues:

1.  Add an application to CloudHub that includes one or more
link:/documentation/display/current/VM+Transport+Reference[VM endpoints]
or that includes a flow set to the queued-asynchronous
link:/documentation/display/current/Flow+Processing+Strategies[processing
strategy]. 
2.  In CloudHub, click the application and click *Settings* >
**Advanced**.
3.  Click the checkbox next to **Persistent queues**.
4.  Click *Apply changes* to enable persistent queues in your
application.

[[ManagingQueues-ViewingQueues]]
== Viewing Queues

After you enable Persistent queues, click **Queues** in the left
navigation menu. CloudHub lists the queues in your application in the
order that they appear in your application:

The name of each queue is determined by the `path` attribute of the
associated VM endpoint, or, in the case of a SEDA queue, from the flow
name.

The **Queued** column shows the number of messages currently waiting on
each of the queues in your application. The *In-Flight* column indicates
the number of messages being processed in the flow after that queue. The
in-flight messages are technically still on the queue until processing
is complete – only then are they deleted from the queue. The *Processed
Messages* column shows a thumbnail graph depicting the number of
messages processed through each queue over the past 24 hours. The Queued
and In-Flight columns update every five seconds, and the Processed
Messages graph updates every five minutes.

 

[[ManagingQueues-ClearingQueues]]
== Clearing Queues

To clear one or more queues, click one or more checkboxes next to the
queues you want to clear, and click **Clear**.

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981189/CHQClearQ.png?version=2&modificationDate=1414205790360[image]

CloudHub presents a warning message that confirms which queues to clear
and the duration this process takes to occur. Click *Clear Queues* to
proceed.

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981189/CHQClear.png?version=1&modificationDate=1414023401602[image]

After you confirm, the queues that you selected display a "Clearing
queue in progress" message until the clearing process is complete:

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981189/CHQClearInProgress.png?version=2&modificationDate=1414126275640[image]

Clearing a queue flushes all messages waiting in the queue and all
in-flight messages. After the queue clearing process is complete, the
queue immediately begins accepting messages again.

 

[[ManagingQueues-Limitations]]
== Limitations

When enabling persistent queues in your application, be aware of the
following:

* Persistent queues do not guarantee one-time-only message delivery.
Duplicate messages may be sent. If one-time-only message delivery is
critical for your use case, do not enable persistent queues.
* If you clear a queue using the Queues tab in the console, any new
messages sent to the queue during the queue clearing process may be
lost.
* Enabling persistent queues has a performance implication: Putting a
small message (50kb or less) on a queue can take 10-20 milliseconds
(ms); taking the same message off a queue can take 70-100ms.
