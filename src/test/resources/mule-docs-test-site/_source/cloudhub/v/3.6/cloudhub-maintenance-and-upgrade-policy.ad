= Maintenance and Upgrade Policy

All maintenance to the CloudHub console, platform services, and worker
cloud (see
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub+Architecture[CloudHub
Architecture]) is performed during the maintenance windows specified in
the http://www.mulesoft.com/terms/msa/current[subscription agreement],
except for critical security issues which are fixed immediately.

It is our policy to perform all maintenance transparently and without
any downtime to your integration(s) running in the worker cloud wherever
possible. In cases where downtime for the console, platform services, or
workers is unavoidable, these maintenance windows will be communicated
at least 8 hours in advance and typically 7 days in advance, with the
exception of critical security patches which may be fixed immediately.

console, CloudHub platform services, and the CloudHub worker cloud on

[[MaintenanceandUpgradePolicy-MuleVersionUpgrades]]
== Mule Version Upgrades

For the worker cloud, there are additional policies which apply to Mule
version upgrades.  For each release type, there is a minimum deprecation
period which starts after a new version is released. This is how long
the previous version will be supported. For example, if a new minor
version 3.6 is released, the previous minor version, 3.5, will be
supported for at least 12 months after the release of 3.6.

 Customers will receive notices prompting them to upgrade their
applications during this deprecation period. If after the specified time
an application is not upgraded, the application will be restarted using
CloudHub Zero Downtime on the new Mule version.
