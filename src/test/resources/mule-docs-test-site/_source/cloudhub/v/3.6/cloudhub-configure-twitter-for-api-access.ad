= Configure Twitter for API Access

This document describes how to enable your Twitter account for API
access. This is required for using the Twitter Connector.

To enable API access, you need to create a "Twitter Application" on the
Twitter Developer website. You will then obtain API credentials which
are needed to configure the Twitter cloud connectors.

== Create a New Twitter Application

1.  If you don't already have a Twitter account, create one at
http://twitter.com/signup. You may wish to create a demo account for
testing. You will need these credentials in the next step.
2.  Go to: https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new to create a new __Twitter
Application__. You may need to sign in using the Twitter account
credentials you just created.
3.  Complete the Application Details form with the following
information: +
1.  Name – Must be unique to the Twitter system (you are not allowed to
use the word "Twitter")
2.  Description – A brief overview of the application you are building
3.  Website – An entry is required here, however, your Twitter
application will not be public unless you choose to do so, so this field
is not meaningful and a placeholder may be entered.
4.  Callback URL – Leave this field blank, because we're not configuring
authentication right now.
4.  Agree to the terms, and click on **Create your Twitter
application**. +
 +
If your application was successfully created, you will be redirected to
an application management page that shows various details about your
application. Note that under the *Application Settings* heading, the
first item is an *Access Level* setting that defaults to read-only. You
may wish to change this in the following steps.

== Change Access Level (If Necessary)

If you are building a project that writes to Twitter, to post Tweets as
an example, you will need to enable write-access for this Twitter
application. To proceed with the following steps, you will need to have
registered your mobile phone number with Twitter. For more information
about how to register your number, see
this https://support.twitter.com/articles/110250-adding-your-mobile-number-to-your-account-via-web[Twitter
support article].

1.  Click on the *Settings* tab in the top menu bar.
2.  Locate the **Access **tab and change the Access radio-button to
**Read and Write**, or to *Read, Write and Access direct messages* if
your project requires direct message functionality.
3.  Click on **Update Settings** to save your change.
4.  Click on the *Details* tab in the top menu bar to return to the
application page.

== Obtain API Credentials

The final step is to generate an access token. If you have not yet
created an access token, you will see an option to create as detailed
below. If you have already created the access token, you can also
generate a new one by following these steps. The access token is
generated based on the access level specified (in the above steps), so
if you change your access level, you need to create a new access token.

1.  Click on the *Keys and Access Tokens* tab. Under the *Your Access
Token* section, click the *Create my access token* button. 
2.  The page will refresh and your new access token will be generated
and ready to use.

You have completed the steps for creating a Twitter application. You now
need to copy the Consumer key, Consumer secret, Access token and Access
token secret into Mule Studio to configure the Twitter connector.

copy fields from the Twitter application menu to the Mule Studio
connector configuration, be sure that you do not copy in additional
leading/trailing characters or spaces. It is a good idea to visually
confirm that your copy and paste functions did not capture surrounding
characters.
