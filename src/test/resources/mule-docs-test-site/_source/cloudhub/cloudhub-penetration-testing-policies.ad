= Penetration Testing Policies

 

If you are deploying applications to
link:/documentation/display/current/CloudHub[CloudHub] or the
link:/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Platform+for+APIs[Anypoint
Platform for APIs] and your company's security policies require that you
run penetration testing on them, there is a way for you to run these.
Given that such tests can interfere with other tenants, penetration
testing is only allowed on your own workers. It is not allowed for any
other services in the Anypoint Platform.

To perform such testing, you must provide a written request 5 business
days in advance to security@mulesoft.com along with:

* Start and end time of testing.
* Hosts which will be included in the test.
* Source IP address or range.
* Contact information, including a phone number and email, for the
individual or team conducting the test.
* You agree to only audit CloudHub workers, and not audit any other
platform services which are common to all tenants.
* You agree not to audit shared workers.
* You must send an email to security@mulesoft.com upon start and
completion of tests.
* You must notify security@mulesoft.com of any vulnerabilities found
immediately.
* You may only audit once a quarter.

After you submit your request, you will receive a written authorization
from of the MuleSoft team, at which point you may proceed with testing
according to your proposed plan.
