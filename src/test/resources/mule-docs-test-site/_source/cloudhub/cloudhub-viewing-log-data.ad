[[ViewingLogData-ViewingLogData]]
= Viewing Log Data

CloudHub provides access to log data so that you can monitor your
application and diagnose any potential issues. CloudHub stores log data
in Universal Time (UTC); however, the console displays the log using
your computer's local time zone. CloudHub saves 100,000 log events per
application. Logs that exceed the limit are truncated every 24 hours to
100,000 events by discarding the oldest events past the limit.
Individual log entries are limited to a maximum length of 100K
characters; longer log entries are truncated to the limit.

[[ViewingLogData-PausingandClearingaLog]]
== Pausing and Clearing a Log

To pause the log so that entries are temporarily stopped from writing,
click *Live view* and click **Pause**. While the log is paused, a green
*Resume* button appears. Click *Resume* to enable more content to be
written.

In **Live view**, you can click the *Clear* button to clear the viewing
window, so you only see the latest logs generated by the application,
which is useful for debugging. The log contents are not deleted, so if
you switch views to Archive and back to Live view, the full contents of
the log reappear. You can also refresh your browser to see the full log.

You can search for any exact term in the log message as well as a few
common quantifiers for wildcard searching:

[cols=",",]
|==================================================================
|? |The question mark matches zero or one of the preceding element.
|* |The asterisk matches zero or more of the preceding element.

[[ViewingLogData-LogPageControls]]
== Log Page Controls

CloudHub provides page controls to help you move through the logs when
you view historical data. The most recent logs are on page one. The data
gets older as you step through the higher pages. 

You can configure the number of results that display on each page by
clicking *Archive* and the down-arrow next to the number of entries:

Click **FIRST**, **LAST**, or the number of entries to view per page,
**10**, **25**, or **50**.

You are prompted for a save location. You can download a maximum of
10,000 lines of log data with a single save. However, using repeated
views with contiguous time windows as search criteria, the entire log
may be downloaded.
