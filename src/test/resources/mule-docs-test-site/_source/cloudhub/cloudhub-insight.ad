*CloudHub Insight* gives you in-depth visibility into business
transactions and events on your Mule applications. By tracking
everything your data does in an application, Insight makes information
searchable and helps you find and recover from any errors that occurred
during message processing and replay your transactions instantly.

CloudHub Insight helps you answer questions about your integrated apps,
such as:

* What happened with a particular transaction or synchronization?
* When did the transaction occur? How long did it take?
* What was the result of a transaction?
* If something went wrong during processing, at what point did the
failure occur?

Using the **Insight Dashboard**, you can view events that occur within
the flows that handle your business transactions. Further, you can drill
down into event-related data to access information that can help you
analyze the root cause of failures, isolate performance bottlenecks, and
test for compliance with company procedures.

By default CloudHub tracks the most recent 100,000 events which occurred
within your application. To arrange to track more, please file a claim
in the
MuleSoft link:/documentation/display/current/Community+and+Support#CommunityandSupport-Support[support
portal].

[[CloudHubInsight-EnablingCloudHubInsight]]
== Enabling CloudHub Insight

To track, aggregate, and store Mule server events by default, CloudHub
Insight requires some processing and network overhead. Complete the
following procedure to enable Insight to track the events your Mule
servers generate. 

1.  Log in to your CloudHub account.
2.  Navigate to the **Settings **page, click *Advanced* and at
**Insight**, click a tracking option: +
* *Metadata* to simply track events.
* **Metadata and Replay** to track events and enable the ability to
instantly replay a transaction from the console. For more information,
see link:#CloudHubInsight-replaysection[Diagnosing Problems and
Replaying Transactions]. **Note**: Replay only works for flows that have
inbound endpoints.
* *Disabled* to not use Insight.
3.  Click **Apply changes** to apply the settings.

After you enable Insight, CloudHub tracks the following events by
default:

* Data that passes through endpoints (inbound and outbound) in your Mule
applications
* Flow initiation and completion
* Custom business events you embed in your Mule flows

 

[[CloudHubInsight-SettingUpBusinessEvents]]
== Setting Up Business Events

You can configure business events in your Mule applications by embedding
custom business events in flows, or by enabling granular event tracking
within message processors in your flows.

* **Custom Business Events –** Include *Custom Business Event* elements
at relevant points within the flows of your application to surface the
processing information that is most relevant for your business to
track. Read more
about link:/documentation/display/current/Business+Events#BusinessEvents-CustomEvents[configuring
custom business events] for details. +
 
* **Event Tracking –** Track more granular events by enabling **default
event tracking** for your entire flow or for specific message processors
or endpoints within your flow. When you configure the flows in your
application, you can explicitly configure the scope for default event
tracking. Read more about
link:/documentation/display/current/Business+Events#BusinessEvents-DefaultEvents[enabling
default business event tracking] in your flows.

 

[[CloudHubInsight-SearchingandFilteringTransactionsandEvents]]
== Searching and Filtering Transactions and Events

The *Insight Dashboard* displays information at three tracking levels:
Transactions, Events, and Metadata. 

* **Transactions** are logical groupings of related events, and often
correspond to a business view of the system.
* **Events** track low-level details of a transaction. Events map to
message processors and endpoints and reveal information about exceptions
and any custom business events you may have configured. 
* **Metadata** tracks customized key/value pairs that you have specified
as part of custom events in your application. The information that
Insight tracks at this level presents information about high-level
business events.

The following image illustrates where to find transactions, events, and
metadata on the Insight dashboard. By default, Insight displays all
transactions in your application for the entire time it has been
tracking transactions, up to a maximum of 100,000.

[[CloudHubInsight-CustomizingtheTransactionID]]
=== Customizing the Transaction ID

For Transaction-level events, Insight may display long numeric values in
the ID column. Rather than use random number identifiers, you may wish
to customize the transaction IDs so that they display more intuitive
values which are relevant to your business requirements.

Use a
link:/documentation/display/current/Mule+Expression+Language+MEL[Mule
expression] to configure your Mule application to return meaningful
information about a transaction, such as order number, tracking number,
or employee identification number. Read more
about link:/documentation/display/current/Business+Events#BusinessEvents-CustomizingtheTransactionId[how
to customize your transaction ID] in Studio's visual editor or XML
editor.  

[[CloudHubInsight-SearchingorFilteringTransactions]]
=== Searching or Filtering Transactions

On the Insight tab of the CloudHub console, you can use a search tool or
filter data to refine the results displayed. This table lists how to
specify search or filter criteria:

Action
To Apply
Display a specific transaction
Click **Insight**. Click *Advanced* in the Search field and in
**Transaction ID**, type the ID value. Click **Apply**.

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981838/CHInTransID.png?version=1&modificationDate=1414210487031[image]

Display only transactions which failed
Indicate **Any**, **Completed**, or *Failed.*

image:/documentation/download/thumbnails/118981838/CHInAny.png?version=1&modificationDate=1414210486990[image]

Display transactions within a specific date range
* Click *Advanced* > *Date & Time* to specify a date or a range: +
 +
image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981838/CHInDateTime.png?version=1&modificationDate=1414210487015[image] +
 +
* Click and drag within the graph to select a specific date range +
 +
image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981838/CH_date+range+click+drag.png?version=1&modificationDate=1414210486890[image]

Locate transactions according to flow name, exception message,
processing time, and/or any custom business data
In your application, click *Advanced* in the *Search* field to locate
additional search parameters.

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981838/CHInBizData.png?version=1&modificationDate=1414210486998[image]

Save Search
To save a search, click **Save search**:

[[CloudHubInsight-FilteringEvents]]
=== Filtering Events

Within transactions, use the **Transaction Details** to further refine
the types of events that Insight displays for each transaction. Click
the events Transaction Details dropdown to reveal possible filter
criteria. If you are debugging, you may find it useful to see all events
so that you can drill down into the detailed steps of your flow. If you
are interested in analyzing higher level business information, you may
wish to apply a filter so as to view only your custom business events. 

image:/documentation/download/thumbnails/118981838/CHTransactionDetails.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416260820599[image]

The *default settings* of the events filter depend upon your CloudHub
user role as follows:

* If your user role is **Support**, the default events filter setting
display only custom events.
* If your user role is *Admin* or **Developer**, the default events
filter setting displays custom events, endpoint events, and message
processor events, but does not display flow events.

 

[[CloudHubInsight-DiagnosingProblemsand ReplayingTransactions]]
== Diagnosing Problems and Replaying Transactions

CloudHub Insight's *Message Replay* feature enables advanced error
recovery. When you encounter a failed transaction (as displayed on
Insight's dashboard), you can diagnose the problem, fix the root issue,
then replay the transaction that failed. The following example
demonstrates this functionality.

[[CloudHubInsight-TransactionFailed]]
==== Transaction Failed

For example, a transaction fails because an application exceeds the
limited number of API calls for a Salesforce account. Insight displays
the status of the transaction as `Failed` (see image below). Click to
expand the transaction, then examine the individual events within that
transaction. Where it failed, you can see the exception and the error
message listed next to the failed event, as well as an existing stack
trace.

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981838/CHExcMsg.png?version=1&modificationDate=1414210486982[image]

 

[[CloudHubInsight-FixthenReplay]]
==== Fix then Replay

After investigating the logs and resolving the issue that caused the
transaction failure – for example, by purchasing more API capacity  –
you can simply replay the transaction.

**Note**: Replay only works for flows that have inbound endpoints.

Click the replay icon (circular arrow) next to the first event in the
failed transaction to replay it:

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981838/CHReplayButton.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416262262358[image]

Insight requests for confirmation (below, top), then confirms that it
has replayed the message during which the transaction first failed
(below, bottom). Insight displays replayed transactions immediately on
the dashboard and in the Logs tab.
