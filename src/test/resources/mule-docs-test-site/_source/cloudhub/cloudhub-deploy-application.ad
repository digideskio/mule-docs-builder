[[DeployApplication-DeployApplication]]
= Deploy Application

The POST method, specified with the /api/applications/\{domain}/deploy
resource (where \{domain} is the application domain), allows you to
deploy a Mule application zip file to CloudHub. This is commonly done
after you've created the application in Mule Studio or using Maven from
the command line- then you need to upload the actual zip file to
CloudHub. After you've deployed the zip file, you can monitor the status
of your deployment by link:/documentation/display/current/Logs[viewing
the logs].
