CloudHub supports worker monitoring and automatic restarts for
unresponsive applications. Monitoring allows you the option to receive
notifications and diagnostic information if your application becomes
unresponsive. Optionally, enable automatic restarts so that your
application can recover automatically without your intervention.
CloudHub gives you the flexibility to conduct monitoring with or without
enabling automatic restarts. 

Monitoring is enabled by default on all applications deployed to
runtimes 3.4.n, 3.5.n, or later. (Applications already deployed before
the monitoring feature was introduced need to be redeployed for
monitoring to take effect.) You can activate the automatic restart
feature on a per-application basis using the CloudHub console when you
deploy a new application or redeploy an existing application.

[[WorkerMonitoring-Assumptions]]
== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar
with http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+a+CloudHub+Application[deploying
applications using the CloudHub console] and that you are deploying to
runtime 3.4.n, 3.5.n, or later. 

 

[[WorkerMonitoring-EnablingAutomaticRestarts]]
== Enabling Automatic Restarts

During deployment, you have the option to enable automatic restarts for
your application. 

Click *Settings* > *Advanced* > **Automatically restart application when
not responding**.

Click *Apply Changes* at the top of the page to complete the setting.

Upon deployment, CloudHub inserts a monitoring ping flow into your
application. When the application is started, the logs display a message
to indicate that monitoring is enabled and that the ping flow has been
injected into your application.

After your application fully starts, the log displays an additional
message to indicate that monitoring has started, "Mule system health
monitoring started for your application." +

[[WorkerMonitoring-HowMonitoringWorks]]
== How Monitoring Works

Every thirty seconds, CloudHub sends an HTTP get request to the ping
flow within the application. If the application is running normally, the
ping flow sends a response. If CloudHub receives no response from the
ping three times in a row, the Logs print a warning and display a full
thread dump.

In addition, CloudHub triggers a notification to the console to alert
you that a worker for this application stopped responding.

If you have configured email alerts, the nonresponsive worker also
triggers an email alert based on the "Worker Not Responding" event.
See link:/documentation/display/current/Alerts+and+Notifications[Alerts
and Notifications] for more information about configuring these alerts.

 

[[WorkerMonitoring-HowAutomaticRestartsWork]]
== How Automatic Restarts Work

If you check the box labeled **Automatically restart application when
not responding**, CloudHub follows the same procedure described above,
but also automatically triggers redeployment of the application. 

If you do not have this box checked, CloudHub only produces a
notification and a log message and will take no further action.

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981349/CH-monitoring-logs5.png?version=1&modificationDate=1413926050239[image]

The monitoring script exits and the application is left unchanged until
you manually intervene.

If you have enabled automatic restart, CloudHub produces a notification
to signal that the restart has been triggered and another to report the
success or failure of the restart: 

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981349/CH-monitoring-notifications.png?version=1&modificationDate=1413926050260[image]

The logs report the details of the restart procedure. If the restart
succeeds, the ping script is reinitialized so that monitoring continues.

image:/documentation/download/attachments/118981349/CH-successfulrestart.png?version=1&modificationDate=1413926050290[image]

If the restart fails, CloudHub continues to attempt restarting up to
five times. Once the maximum number of restart attempts is exceeded,
CloudHub takes no further action. The monitoring script exits and the
application is left unchanged until you manually intervene.
